<a name="2.3.1"></a><H3>2.3.1 Commensal, feral, and aboriginal animals</H3>

<P>Animals that are members of the genus <i>Mus</i> can be further classified according 
to their relationship to humankind. The house mouse represents one group within 
this genus that is characterized by its ability to live in close association with people. 
Animals dependent on human shelter and/or activity for their survival are referred 
to as <A href="glossary.shtml#Commensal" TARGET="_top"><i>commensal</i></A> animals.
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#7" TARGET="_top">7</a></sup> 
As discussed 
<A HREF="2.3.shtml#later">later in this chapter</A>, all commensal mice 
appear to be members of a single species &#151; <i>Mus musculus</i> &#151; that can be subdivided 
into four distinct subspecies groups with different geographical ranges.

<P>Although the success of <i>M. musculus</i> throughout the world is dependent on its 
status as a commensal species, in some regions with appropriate environmental 
conditions, animals have reverted back to a non-commensal state, severing their 
dependence on humankind. Such mice are referred to as 
<a href="glossary.shtml#Feral" TARGET="_top"><i>feral</i></a>. The return to the 
wild can occur most readily with a mild climate, sufficient vegetation or other food 
source, and weak competition from other species. Feral mice have successfully 
colonized small islands off Great Britain and in the South Atlantic 
(<a href="references.shtml#Berry4" TARGET="_top">Berry et al., 1987</a>), 
and in Australia, <i>M. musculus</i> has replaced some indigenous species. 
Although feral populations exist in North America and Europe as well, here they 
seem to be at a disadvantage relative to other small indigenous rodents such as 
<i>Apodemus</i> (field mice in Europe), <i>Peromyscus</i> (American deer mice), and <i>Microtus</i> 
(American voles). In some geographical areas, individual house mice will switch 
back and forth from a feral to a commensal state according to the season &#151; in mid-
latitude temperate zones, human shelters are much more essential in the winter 
than in the summertime. 

<P>None of the remaining species in the genus <i>Mus</i> (indicated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf22 = window.open('figure2.2.shtml', 'windowf22', 'width=720,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf22.focus()">Figure 2.2</a>) 
have the ability to live commensally. These animals are not, and their ancestors never 
have been, dependent on humans for survival. Such animals are referred to as 
<i>aboriginal</i>.

<a name="2.3.2"></a><H3>2.3.2 Systematics of the house mouse</H3>

<P>Although the average person cannot distinguish a field mouse from a house 
mouse, taxonomists have gone in the opposite direction describing numerous <i>types</i> 
of house mouse species. In the book <i>The Genetics of the Mouse</i> published in 1943, 
Gr&#252;nberg wrote &#034;The taxonomy of the <i>musculus</i> group of mice is in urgent need of 
revision. About fifty names of reputed 'good species', sub-species, local varieties and 
synonyms occur in the literature, all of which refer to members of this group.&#034; 
(<a href="references.shtml#Gruneberg1" TARGET="_top">Gr&#252;neberg, 1943</a>). <i>M. brevirostris</i>, 
<i>M. poschiavinus</i>, <i>M. praetextus</i>, and <i>M. wagneri</i> 
are among the 114 species names for various house mice present in the literature by 1981 
(<a href="references.shtml#Marshall3" TARGET="_top">Marshall, 1981</a>). One reason for this early confusion was the high level of 
variation in coat color and tail length that exists among house mice from different 
geographical regions. In particular, the belly can vary in color from nearly white to dark gray 
(<a href="references.shtml#Sage1" TARGET="_top">Sage, 1981</a>). A second reason for more recent taxonomic subdivisions 
was the discovery of a large variation in chromosome number among different 
European populations (discussed in 
<a href="5.2.shtml#5.2.2">Chapter 5</a>). These differences and others led 
traditional taxonomists to conclude the existence of numerous house mouse 
species.<A NAME="later"></A>

<P>Over the last decade, the power of molecular biology has been combined with a 
more detailed investigation of breeding complementarity to sort out the true 
systematics of the house mouse group [see review by 
<a href="references.shtml#Boursot1" TARGET="_top">Boursot et al. (1993)</a>]. Much of 
the credit for this comprehensive analysis goes to two groups of researchers &#151; one at 
Berkeley including Sage, Wilson, and their colleagues 
(<a href="references.shtml#Sage1" TARGET="_top">Sage, 1981</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Ferris2" TARGET="_top">Ferris et al., 1983b</a>), 
and the second in Montpellier including Thaler, Bonhomme, and their colleagues 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme3" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme et al., 1978a</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme9" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme et al., 1978b</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Britton1" TARGET="_top">Britton and Thaler, 1978</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme4" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme et al., 1984</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme6" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme and Gu&#233;net, 1989</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Auffray1" TARGET="_top">Auffray et al., 1991</a>). 
Moriwaki and his colleagues have also contributed to this analysis 
(<a href="references.shtml#Yonekawa2" TARGET="_top">Yonekawa et al., 1981</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Yonekawa3" TARGET="_top">Yonekawa et al., 1988</a>). The accumulated data clearly demonstrate the 
existence of four primary forms of the house mouse &#151; <i>domesticus</i>, <i>musculus</i>, 
<i>castaneus</i>, and <i>bactrianus</i> 
(<a href="javascript:windowf22 = window.open('figure2.2.shtml', 'windowf22', 'width=720,height=580,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf22.focus()">Figure 2.2</a>). 
Two of these four groups &#151; <i>domesticus</i> and <i>musculus</i> &#151; are each relatively homogenous at the genetic level whereas the other two are not 
(<a href="references.shtml#Boursot1" TARGET="_top">Boursot et al., 1993</a>). In particular, mice from the <i>bactrianus</i> group 
show a high level of genetic heterogeneity. The Montpellier team has interpreted 
these findings as strong supporting evidence for the hypothesis that the Indian 
subcontinent represents the ancestral home of all house mice and that <i>bactrianus</i> 
animals are descendants of this very old founder population. In contrast, the 
<i>musculus</i> and <i>domesticus</i> groups have more recent founders that derive from the 
ancestral <i>bactrianus</i> population 
(<a href="references.shtml#Boursot1" TARGET="_top">Boursot et al., 1993</a>).
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#8" TARGET="_top">8</a></sup> 

<P>Although the four groups can be distinguished morphologically and 
molecularly, and have different non-overlapping ranges around the world 
(<a href="javascript:windowf23 = window.open('figure2.3.shtml', 'windowf23', 'width=670,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf23.focus()">Figure 2.3</a>), 
it is clear at the DNA level that individuals within all these groups are 
descendants of a common ancestor that lived between 800,000 and 1 myr  
ago. Individuals representing pure samples from each of the four groups can 
interbreed readily in the laboratory to produce fertile male and female offspring. 
The high level of morphologic and karyotypic variation that has been observed 
among house mice from different regions must be a consequence of rapid 
adaptation to aspects of the many varied environments in which the house mouse 
can survive and thrive. The previously identified &#034;false species&#034; <i>M. brevirostris</i>, <i>M. 
poschiavinus</i>, and <i>M. praetextus</i> are not distinguishable genetically and are all 
members of the <i>domesticus</i> group. 

<a name="2.3.3"></a><H3>2.3.3 Hybrid zones and the species debate</H3>

<P>Although mouse systematicists have reached a consensus on the structure of the 
<I>Mus musculus</I> group &#151; with the existence of only four well-defined subgroups &#151; 
there is still a question as to whether each of these subgroups represents a separate 
species, or whether each is simply a subspecies, or race, within a single 
all-encompassing house mouse species. The very fact that this question is not simply 
answered attests to the clash that exists between: (1) those who would define two 
populations as separate species only if they could not produce fully viable and fertile 
hybrid offspring, whether in a laboratory or natural setting, and (2) those who 
believe that species should be defined strictly in geographical and population terms, 
based on the existence of a natural barrier (of any kind) to gene flow between the two 
populations 
(<a href="references.shtml#Barton1" TARGET="_top">Barton and Hewitt, 1989</a>). 

<P>The first question to be asked is whether this is simply a semantical argument 
between investigators without any bearing on biology. At what point in the 
divergence of two populations from each other is the magic line crossed when they 
become distinct species? Obviously, the line must be fuzzy. Perhaps, the house 
mouse groups are simply in this fuzzy area at this moment in evolutionary time, so 
why argue about their classification? The answer is that an understanding of the 
evolution of the <i>Mus</i> group in particular, and the entire definition of species in 
general, is best served by pushing this debate as far as it will go, which is the purpose 
of what follows.

<P>Each of the four primary house mouse groups occupies a distinct geographical 
range as shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowf23 = window.open('figure2.3.shtml', 'windowf23', 'width=670,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf23.focus()">Figure 2.3</a>. 
Together, these ranges have expanded out to cover nearly the entire land mass on the globe. 
In theory, it might be possible to solve the species versus sub-species debate by examining the interactions that occur between 
different house mouse groups whose ranges have bumped-up against each other. If 
all house mice were members of the same species, barriers to interbreeding might 
not exist, and as such, one might expect boundaries between ranges to be extremely 
diffuse with broad gradients of mixed genotypes. This would be the prediction of 
laboratory observations, where members of both sexes from each house mouse 
group can interbreed readily with individuals from all other groups to produce 
viable and fertile offspring of both sexes that <i>appear</i> to be just as fit in all respects as 
offspring derived from matings within a group. 

<P>However, just because productive interbreeding occurs in the laboratory does not 
mean that it will occur in the wild where selective processes act in full force. It 
could be argued that two populations should be defined as separate species if the 
offspring that result from interbreeding are less fit <i>in the real world</i> than offspring 
obtained through matings within either group. It is known that subtle effects on 
fitness can have dramatic effects in nature and yet go totally unrecognized in 
captivity. If this were the case with hybrids formed between different house mouse 
groups, the dynamics of interactions between different populations would be quite 
different from the melting-pot prediction described above. In particular, since 
inter-specific crosses would be &#034;non-productive,&#034; genotypes from the two populations 
would remain distinct. Nevertheless, if the two populations favored different 
ecological niches, their ranges could actually overlap even as each group (species) 
maintained its genetic identity &#151; such species are considered to be <i>
<a href="glossary.shtml#Sympatric" TARGET="_top">sympatric</a></i>. 
Examples of sympatric species within the context of the broader <i>Mus</i> genus are 
described in <a href="2.3.shtml#2.3.5">Section 2.3.5</a>.

<P>Species that have just recently become distinct from each other would be more 
likely to demand the same ecological niches. In this case, ranges would not overlap 
since all of the niches in each range would already be occupied by the species 
members that got there first. Instead, the barrier to gene flow would result in the 
formation of a distinct boundary between the two ranges. Boundary regions of this 
type are called hybrid zones because along these narrow geographical lines, members 
of each population can interact and mate to form viable hybrids, even though gene 
flow across the entire width of the hybrid zone is generally blocked 
(<a href="references.shtml#Barton1" TARGET="_top">Barton and Hewitt, 1989</a>). 

<P>The best-characterized house mouse hybrid zone runs through the center of 
Europe and separates the <I>domesticus</I> group to the West from the musculus group to 
the East 
(<a href="javascript:windowf23 = window.open('figure2.3.shtml', 'windowf23', 'width=670,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf23.focus()">Figure 2.3</a>). 
If, as the one-species protagonists claim, <i>musculus</i> and 
<i>domesticus</i> mice simply arrived in Europe and spread toward the center by different 
routes &#151; <i>domesticus</i> from the southwest and <i>musculus</i> from the east &#151; then upon 
meeting in the middle, the expectation would be that they would readily mix 
together. This should lead to a hybrid zone which broadens with time until 
eventually it disappears. In its place initially, one would expect a continuous 
gradient of the characteristics present in the original two groups. 

<P>In contrast to this expectation, the European hybrid zone does not appear to be 
widening. Rather, it appears to be stably maintained at a width of less than 20 
kilometers 
(<a href="references.shtml#Sage3" TARGET="_top">Sage et al., 1986</a>). Since hybridization between the two groups of mice 
does occur in this zone, what prevents the spreading of most genes beyond it? The 
answer seems to be that hybrid animals in this zone are less fit than those with pure 
genotypes on either side. One manner in which this reduced fitness is expressed is 
through the inability of the hybrids to protect themselves against intestinal 
parasites. Sage 
(<a href="references.shtml#Sage3" TARGET="_top">Sage, 1986</a>) has shown through direct studies of captured animals 
that hybrid zone mice with mixed genotypes carry a much larger parasitic load, in 
the form of intestinal worms. This finding has been independently confirmed 
(<a href="references.shtml#Moulia1" TARGET="_top">Moulia et al., 1991</a>). Superficially, these "wormy mice" do not appear to be less 
healthy than normal; however, one can easily imagine a negative effect on 
reproductive fitness through a reduced life span and other changes in overall 
vitality.

<P>Nevertheless, for a subset of genes and gene complexes, the hybrid zone does <i>not</i> 
act as a barrier to transmission across group lines. In particular, there is evidence for 
the flow of mitochondrial genes from <i>domesticus</i> animals in Germany to <i>musculus</i> 
animals in Scandinavia 
(<a href="references.shtml#Ferris1" TARGET="_top">Ferris et al., 1983a</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Gyllensten1" TARGET="_top">Gyllensten and Wilson, 1987</a>) with the 
reverse flow observed in Bulgaria and Greece 
(<a href="references.shtml#Boursot2" TARGET="_top">Boursot et al., 1984</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Vanlerberghe1" TARGET="_top">Vanlerberghe et al., 1988</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme6" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme and Gu&#233;net, 1989</a>). An even more dramatic example of gene 
flow can be seen with a variant form of chromosome 17 &#151; called a <i>t</i> 
<A HREF="glossary.shtml#Haplotype" TARGET="_top">haplotype</A> &#151; that 
has passed freely across the complete ranges of all four groups 
(<a href="references.shtml#Silver10" TARGET="_top">Silver et al., 1987</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Hammer1" TARGET="_top">Hammer et al., 1991</a>).

<P>In contrast to the stable hybrid zone in Europe, other boundaries between 
different house mouse ranges are likely to be much more diffuse. The extreme form 
of this situation is the complete mixing of two house mouse groups &#151; <I>castaneus</I> and 
<I>musculus</I> &#151; that has taken place on the Japanese islands 
(<a href="references.shtml#Yonekawa2" TARGET="_top">Yonekawa et al., 1988</a>, see 
<a href="javascript:windowf23 = window.open('figure2.3.shtml', 'windowf23', 'width=670,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf23.focus()">Figure 2.3</a>). 
So thorough has this mixing been that the hybrid group obtained was 
considered to be a separate group unto itself 
&#151; with the name <i>Mus molossinus</i> 
&#151; until DNA analysis showed otherwise.

<P>In the end, there is no clear solution to the one species versus multiple species 
debate and it comes down to a matter of taste. However, the consensus has been 
aptly summarized by Bonhomme: &#034;None of the four main units is completely 
genetically isolated from the other three, none is able to live sympatrically with any 
other. In those locations where they meet, there is evidence of exchange ranging 
from differential introgression... to a complete blending. It is therefore necessary 
to keep all these taxonomical units, whose evolutionary fate is unpredictable, 
within a species framework&#034; 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme6" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme and Gu&#233;net, 1989</a>). Thus, in line with 
this consensus, I will describe the four house mouse groups by their subspecies 
names <i>M. m. musculus</i>, <i>M. m. domesticus</i>, <i>M. m. castaneus</i>, and <i>M. m. bactrianus</i>. I 
will use <i>M. musculus</i> as a generic term in general discussions of house mice, where 
the specific subspecies is unimportant or unknown.

<a name="2.3.4"></a><H3>2.3.4 Origin of the classical inbred strains</H3>

<P>As presented in 
<a href="1.2.shtml">Chapter 1</a>, the original inbred strains were derived almost 
exclusively from the fancy mice purchased by geneticists from pet mouse breeders 
like Abbie Lathrop and others at the beginning of the 20th century. Mouse 
geneticists have always been aware of the multi-facted derivation of the fancy mice 
from native animals captured in Japan, China, and Europe. Thus, it is not 
surprising that none of the original inbred strains are truly representative of any 
one house mouse group, but rather each is a mosaic of <i>M. m. domesticus</i>, 
<i>M. m. musculus</i>, <i>M. m. castaneus</i>, and perhaps <i>M. m. bactrianus</i> as well 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme8" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme et al., 1987</a>). Nevertheless, the accumulated data suggest that the most 
prominent component of this mosaic is <i>M. m. domesticus</i>.

<P>In early comparative DNA studies carried out with the use of restriction 
enzymes, the classical inbred lines were analyzed to determine the derivation of two 
particular genomic components &#151; the mitochondrial chromosome and the Y 
chromosome. The findings were surprising. First, all of the classical inbred strains 
were found to carry mitochondria derived exclusively from <i>domesticus</i> 
(<a href="references.shtml#Yonekawa3" TARGET="_top">Yonekawa et al., 1980</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Ferris3" TARGET="_top">Ferris et al., 1982</a>). 
Even more surprising was the fact that the 
mitochondrial genomes present in all of the inbred strains were identical, implying 
a common descent along the maternal line back to a female who could have lived as 
recently as 1920. 

<P>The Y chromosome results also showed a limited ancestry, but, in contrast to the 
mitochondrial results, the great majority of the classical inbred strains have a 
common paternal-line ancestor that came from <i>musculus</i> 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bishop2" TARGET="_top">Bishop et al., 1985</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Tucker1" TARGET="_top">Tucker et al., 1992</a>). Again, a large number of what are thought to be independent 
inbred strains (including B6, BALB/c, LP, LT, SEA, 129, and others) carry 
indistinguishable Y chromosomes 
(<a href="references.shtml#Tucker1" TARGET="_top">Tucker et al., 1992</a>). Ferris and colleagues 
(<a href="references.shtml#Ferris3" TARGET="_top">Ferris et al., 1982</a>) suggest that, contrary to the published records, early interstrain 
contaminations may have been responsible for a much closer relationship among 
many of the inbred lines than had been previously assumed. It was, in fact, the 
absence of sufficient inter-strain variation that served as the impetus to use more 
novel approaches to linkage analysis in the mouse such as the interspecific crosses 
described in the 
<A HREF="2.3.shtml#2.3.5">next section</A> and in more detail in 
<a href="9.3.shtml">Chapter 9</a>. 
<a href="references.shtml#Atchley1" TARGET="_top">Atchley and Fitch (1991)</a> have constructed a phylogenetic tree that shows the relative overall genetic 
relatedness among 24 common inbred strains.

<P>For many biological studies, use of the classical inbred strains is perfectly 
acceptable even though they are not actually representative of any race found in 
nature. However, in some cases, especially in studies that impact on aspects of 
evolution or population biology, it obviously does make a difference to use animals 
with genomes representative of naturally occurring populations. It is only in the 
last decade that a major effort has been devoted to the generation of new inbred 
lines directly from wild mice certified to represent particular <i>M. musculus</i>
subgroups. It is now possible to purchase inbred lines representative of <i>M. m. 
domesticus</i>, <i>M. m. musculus</i>, and <i>M. m. castaneus</i> (as well as the <i>M. m. molossinus</i> 
hybrid race) from the 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Jackson Laboratory</A>. Many other inbred lines have been 
derived from mice captured in particular localities and a list of investigators that 
maintain such lines has been published 
(<a href="references.shtml#Potter1" TARGET="_top">Potter et al., 1986</a>).

<a name="2.3.5"></a><H3>2.3.5 Close relatives of <i>Mus musculus</i> and interpopulation hybrids</H3>

<P>A phylogenetic tree showing the relationships that exist among close relatives of 
the house moues <i>M. musculus</i> is presented in 
<a href="javascript:windowf22 = window.open('figure2.2.shtml', 'windowf22', 'width=720,height=580,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf22.focus()">Figure 2.2</a>. 
All Mus species have the same basic karyotype of 40 acrocentric chromosomes.
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#9" TARGET="_top">9</a></sup> 
The three closest known 
relatives of <i>Mus musculus</i> are aboriginal species with restricted ranges within and 
near Europe. All three species &#151; <i>M. spretus</i>, <i>M. spicilegus</i>, and 
<i>M. macedonicus</i> &#151; are 
sympatric with <i>M. musculus</i> but interspecific hybrids are not produced in nature. 
Thus, there is a complete barrier to gene flow between the house mice and each of 
these aboriginal species. The ability of two animal populations to live sympatrically 
&#151; with overlapping ranges &#151; in the absence of gene flow is the clearest indication 
that the two populations represent different species. Nevertheless, in the forced, 
confined environment of a laboratory cage, Bonhomme and colleagues were able to 
demonstrate the production of interspecific F<sub>1</sub> hybrids between each of these 
aboriginal species and <i>M. musculus</i> 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme9" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme et al., 1978</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme4" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme et al., 1984</a>).

<P>The best characterized of the aboriginal species is <i>Mus spretus</i>, a western 
Mediterranean short-tailed mouse with a range across the most southwestern 
portion of France, through most of Spain and Portugal, and across the North 
African coast above the Sahara in Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme6" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme and Gu&#233;net, 1989</a>). 
<i>M. spretus</i> is sympatric with the <i>M. m. domesticus</i> group across its 
entire range. In 1978, Bonhomme and his colleagues reported the landmark finding 
that <i>M. spretus</i> males and laboratory strain females could be bred to produce viable 
offspring of both sexes 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme3" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme et al., 1978</a>). Although all male hybrids are 
sterile, the female hybrid is fully fertile and can be backcrossed to either <i>M. 
musculus</i> or <i>M. spretus</i> males to obtain fully viable second generation offspring.
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#10" TARGET="_top">10</a></sup> 

<P>In a series of subsequent papers, Bonhomme and colleagues demonstrated the 
power of the interspecific cross for performing multi-locus linkage analysis with 
molecular and biochemical makers 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme2" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme et al., 1979</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme7" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme et al., 1982</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Avner2" TARGET="_top">Avner et al., 1988</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Guenet1" TARGET="_top">Gu&#233;net et al., 1990</a>). With the large evolutionary distance that 
separates the two parental species, it is possible to readily find alternative DNA and 
biochemical alleles at nearly every locus in the genome. This finding stands in stark 
contrast to the high level of non-polymorphism observed at the majority of loci 
examined within the classical inbred lines. The significance of the interspecific cross 
for mouse genetics cannot be understated: it was the single most important factor in 
the development of a whole genome linkage map based on molecular markers 
during the last half of the 1980s. A detailed discussion of the actual protocols 
involved in such a linkage analysis will be presented in 
<a href="9.3.shtml">Chapter 9</a>.

<P>Two other well-defined aboriginal species have non-overlapping ranges in 
Eastern Europe. <i>Mus spicilegus</i> (previously known as <i>M. hortulanus</i> or species 4B) 
is commonly referred to as the mound-building mouse. Its range is restricted to the 
steppe grassland regions north and west of the Black Sea in current-day Bulgaria, 
Romania, and Ukraine 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme3" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme et al., 1978</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Sage1" TARGET="_top">Sage, 1981</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme5" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme et al., 1983</a>). 
<i>Mus macedonicus</i> (previously known as <i>M. abbotti</i>, <i>M. spretoides</i>, or species 4A) is 
restricted in range to the eastern Mediterranean across Greece and Turkey; this very 
short-tailed species is the Eastern European equivalent of <i>M. spretus</i> in terms of 
ecological niches. <i>M. spicilegus</i> and <i>M. macedonicus</i> are an interesting pair of 
species in that they are barely distinguishable from each other morphologically, and 
yet they fail to interbreed in the wild, and successful attempts at interbreeding in the 
laboratory have yet to be published.
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#11" TARGET="_top">11</a></sup> 
Nevertheless, males from both species can be 
bred with <i>M. musculus</i> to give an outcome identical to that obtained with the 
<i>M. spretus</i>-<i>M. musculus</i> cross &#151; both male and female hybrid offspring are fully 
viable, however, only the females are fertile 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme4" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme et al., 1984</a>). 

<P>Presumably, both of these interspecific hybrid types could be used for linkage 
analysis in the same manner as that described above. However, in general, these 
crosses would not provide any obvious advantage over the <i>spretus</i>-<i>musculus</i> cross. 
The one exception to this statement would be in chromosomal regions where 
<i>spretus</i> and <i>musculus</i> were distinguished by an inversion polymorphism that did 
not distinguish <i>musculus</i> from either <i>macedonicus</i> or <i>spiciligus</i>. The presence of 
an inversion polymorphism will prevent recombination in F<sub>1</sub> hybrids and can lead 
to false estimates of gene distances. In only one instance to date has such a 
polymorphism between <i>spretus</i> and <i>musculus</i> been demonstrated &#151; in the 
proximal region of chromosome 17 
(<a href="references.shtml#Hammer2" TARGET="_top">Hammer et al., 1989</a>). This inversion can 
cause a suppression of recombination over a chromosomal region that extends far 
beyond the inverted region itself 
(<a href="references.shtml#Himmelbauer1" TARGET="_top">Himmelbauer and Silver, 1993</a>). In the case of 
this particular chromosomal region, <i>musculus</i> and <i>macedonicus</i> have been shown 
to share the same gene order leading to the occurrence of normal recombination in 
the <i>macedonicus</i>-<i>musculus</i> F<sub>1</sub> hybrid 
(<a href="references.shtml#Hammer2" TARGET="_top">Hammer et al., 1989</a>). 

<P>The failure to find other inversion polymorphisms does not mean that they do 
not exist. Inversions can only be demonstrated formally by creating a linkage map 
for <i>M. spretus</i> by itself and comparing the gene order on this map to the gene order 
on a <i>M. musculus</i> map. This has not been done for any chromosome other than the 
seventeenth. Nevertheless, a recent comparison of linkage maps constructed from 
the <i>spretus</i>-<i>musculus</i> cross and an intersubspecific <i>domesticus</i>-<i>castaneus</i> cross 
points to several additional regions where inversion polymorphisms are implicated 
based on the observation of localized recombination suppression in the interspecific 
cross only 
(<a href="references.shtml#Copeland2" TARGET="_top">Copeland et al., 1993</a>). Cryptic inversions could have serious 
consequences for those using linkage map distances as means for estimating the 
physical length of DNA that must be walked from a cloned marker to a gene of 
interest as discussed more fully in 
<a href="10.3.shtml">Chapter 10</a>.

<P>Other more-distant members of the genus <i>Mus</i> have evolved in and around 
India. These include <i>M. caroli</i>, <i>M. cooki</i>, <i>M. cervicolor</i>, <i>M. booduga</i>, and <i>M. dunni</i>. 
None of these species can produce interspecific hybrids with any representatives of 
the <i>M. musculus</i> complex under normal laboratory conditions. However, with 
artificial insemination, Chapman and colleagues were able to demonstrate fertilized 
embryos representing F<sub>1</sub> hybrids between <i>M. musculus</i> and <i>M. caroli</i>, <i>M. cervicolor</i>, 
or <i>M. dunni </i> 
(<a href="references.shtml#West1" TARGET="_top">West et al., 1977</a>). However, the embryos formed with <i>M. musculus</i> 
and either <i>M. dunni</i> or <i>M. cervicolor</i> never gave rise to live-born animals, with 
most <i>cervicolor</i>-<i>musculus</i> hybrids failing to undergo even the first cleavage 
division, and most <i>dunni</i>-<i>musculus</i> hybrids failing at the blastocyst stage. Although 
most <i>caroli</i>-<i>musculus</i> embryos also died prenatally, a small number actually made it 
through to a live birth. These interspecific hybrids were all delivered by Caesarian 
Section; they were usually small and only a few survived after fostering to nursing 
mothers. None were shown to be fertile, although the sample size was exceedingly 
small.

<P>Inbred lines developed from a number of different <i>Mus</i> species, including <i>M. 
spretus</i> and <i>M. spicilegus</i> (<i>M. hortulanus</i>) are available for purchase from the 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Jackson Laboratory</A>. In addition, outbred stocks representing most of the other <i>Mus</i> 
species are maintained by individual investigators [listed in 
(<a href="references.shtml#Potter1" TARGET="_top">Potter et al., 1986</a>)].

<B>Figure 9.16</B> 
Interpretation of the absence of recombination between two loci in a backcross analysis with 15-100 animals. 
Median linkage distance estimates and upper limits on the 68% and 95% confidence intervals are indicated for cases where no recombination is observed between lwo loci among all members of a backcross panel. 
Distances are shown in

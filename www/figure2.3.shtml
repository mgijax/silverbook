Geographical ranges of subspecies in the <I>M. musculus</I> group.
The range of each subspecies is indicated with a different pattern.
The presumed paths of dispersion of the <I>M. m. domesticus</I> group during the last 600 years are indicated with mouse icons and arrows.
The movement of the two Asian subspecies onto the Japanese islands (also indicated with arrows) to form the hybrid <I>faux</I>-species <I>M. m. molossinus</I> is likely to have occurred much earlier.
The information presented here is based on figures shown in several publications authored by Francis Bonhomme and his colleagues

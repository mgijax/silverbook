<B>Figure 9.1</B> 
Illustration of centromere mapping by secondary oocyte analysis. 
The different meiotic outcomes possible for a single pair of homologs in females heterozygous for a marker locus <I>M</I> (with <I>M</I> and <I>m</I> alleles) are shown from the primary oocyte to the secondary oocyte stage. 
Sister chromatids are shown attached at their centromeres. 
Each single crossover event between the centromere and the marker <I>M</I> results in the formation of two secondary oocytes that contain both alleles (<I>Mm</I>). 
Thus, the total fraction of individual oocytes with two alleles is equal to twice the recombination distance between the centromere and the marker.

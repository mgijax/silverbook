<B>Figure 3.1</B> 
Consequences of inbreeding at the F<SUB>2</SUB> generation. 
The first cross illustrated is an outcross between animals homozygous for alternative alleles at the <I>A</I> locus. 
The F<SUB>1</SUB> offspring are all identically heterozygous <I>A/a</I>. 
An intercross between two F<SUB>1</SUB> animals will produce an F<SUB>2</SUB> generation with three possible 
genotypes havingthe probabilities shown. 
The final box indicates the different combinations of F<SUB>2</SUB> by F<SUB>2</SUB> matings that are possible 
and the probabilities associated with each one. 
The two mating combinations that cause fixation for one allele are circled. 
This illustration of the process of inbreeding is based on two simplifying assumptions: (1) genetic homogeneity 
in each of the original parents used for the outcross, and (2) contrasting alleles at every locus in these original parents. 
In actuality, inbreeding is often begun with parents that, on the one hand, are not homogeneous but, on the 
other hand, do share many alleles with each other.

<B>Figure 5.8</B>  
Illustration of genomic imprinting. 
The genotypes around an imprinted gene are shown for two parents, their gametes and their offspring. 
The gene is represented by an open box. 
The imprinting "mark" is represented by a stippled box adjacent to the gene, and the imprinted state itself is indicated with an X across the gene.

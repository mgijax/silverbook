<a name="2.4.1"></a><H3>2.4.1 Shelter, food, and water</H3>

<P><i>Mus musculus</i> can live in an incredible variety of different habitats. 
<A HREF="glossary.shtml#Commensal" TARGET="_top">Commensal</A> 
animals can live in all types of human-made structures including houses, buildings, 
barns, haystacks, ruins, and in coal mines, 1,800 feet below the ground. The 
possibilities are virtually unlimited &#151; animals have been found in climates as 
different as frozen-food lockers and central heating ducts 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bronson1" TARGET="_top">Bronson, 1984</a>). 
<A HREF="glossary.shtml#Feral" TARGET="_top">Feral</A> 
animals can live in agricultural fields, meadows, and scrublands 
(<a href="references.shtml#Sage1" TARGET="_top">Sage, 1981</a>). In 
most places, they do not normally live in woodlands or forest, but even this is 
possible in areas, such as islands, where natural predators do not exist 
(<a href="references.shtml#Berry3" TARGET="_top">Berry and Jakobson, 1974</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Berry4" TARGET="_top">Berry et al., 1987</a>). The survival of feral mice is often dependent on 
the production of nests and burrow systems which act to ameliorate the prevailing 
air temperatures 
(<a href="references.shtml#Sage1" TARGET="_top">Sage, 1981</a>). Both sexes construct nests which can range from 
very simple to highly complex enclosed structures used for food storage as well as 
nesting. Feral animals can display a highly developed homing behavior and are 
capable of returning to their nests after long distance (250 m) displacement 
(<a href="references.shtml#Sage1" TARGET="_top">Sage, 
1981</a>). Mice can eat almost anything &#151; cereals, grass, seeds, roots and stems of 
various plants, adult insects, and even larvae 
(<a href="references.shtml#Rowe1" TARGET="_top">Rowe, 1981</a>). Animals can also 
subsist with very little water, especially if their food is high in moisture content 
(<a href="references.shtml#Gruneberg1" TARGET="_top">Gr&#252;neberg, 1943</a>). In many locations, the morning dew can probably provide 
much of the daily water requirement 
(<a href="references.shtml#Rowe1" TARGET="_top">Rowe, 1981</a>). These traits provide the house 
mouse with great adaptability and have played an important role in their dispersion 
among many different habitats, both commensal and feral.

<a name="2.4.2"></a><H3>2.4.2 Population structures and reproduction</H3>

<P>The paradigm population structure for animals living under commensal 
conditions is that of independent, relatively stable 
<i><A HREF="glossary.shtml#Deme" TARGET="_top">demes</A></i>, or families. The classic 
deme will have a single dominant male who patrols a well-defined home range and 
sires most of the young; up to ten breeding female members of the deme will 
confine their own ranges to that of the single dominant male. 
<P>Different dominant males will have mutually exclusive territories. Males will tolerate their own 
offspring, but will kill offspring born to females that belong to other demes. In 
highly structured populations of this type, the level of interdemic migration is very 
low, even between nesting sites located within a few meters of each other 
(<a href="references.shtml#Sage1" TARGET="_top">Sage, 1981</a>).

<P>In reality, the picture of demes presented above is an idealized situation that may 
actually define the structure of some populations but not others, and at some points 
in times, but not others. In the presence of an ample food supply and in the absence 
of predators or competitors, populations appear to retain a higher level of structure. 
However, demes can vary in size from two animals to at least 100; the amount of 
interdemic migration can vary between none and all; and the detailed structure of a 
population can change drastically in response to changes in the environment.

<P>Under optimal environmental conditions with plenty of food and nesting 
material, commensal mice living inside temperature-controlled buildings can breed 
throughout the year 
(<a href="references.shtml#Rowe1" TARGET="_top">Rowe, 1981</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Sage1" TARGET="_top">Sage, 1981</a>). In strictly feral populations in 
temperate climates, breeding activity tends to be seasonal, from spring to early autumn 
(<a href="references.shtml#Rowe1" TARGET="_top">Rowe, 1981</a>). The average litter size has been found to vary from as few as 
three pups to as many as nine. Although mice from some laboratory lines can 
survive as long as three years, free-living wild animals are likely to die much earlier 
from disease, competition, or predators.

<P>The usual structure of feral populations may be very different from that of 
commensal populations in that animals living outdoors appear to move over much 
larger distances, and deme structures appear to be much less stable 
(<a href="references.shtml#Berry3" TARGET="_top">Berry and Jakobson, 1974</a>). However, the ability and desire of mice to migrate over long 
distances is complex and highly variable. Many animals appear to live their entire 
lives in very small and well-defined home ranges (defined as the area in which an 
animal spends the vast majority of its time) of less than 10 m across. Others 
will move constantly over much larger distances, traveling kilometers daily, and 
some will migrate long distances between home ranges that are very small. All 
possible permutations are possible, and the distribution of animals in each class 
varies greatly among different populations. The lifestyle of the house mouse has 
been described aptly by Berry: &#034;The house mouse is a weed: quick to exploit 
opportunity, and able to withstand local adversity... A consequence of the repeated 
formation of new populations by small numbers of founders is that every 
population is likely to be unique.&#034; 
(<a href="references.shtml#Berry1" TARGET="_top">Berry, 1981</a>).

<a name="2.4.3"></a><H3>2.4.3 Adaptability and success</H3>

<P>The incredible adaptability of <i>M. musculus</i> to new environments can be 
accounted for almost entirely by the enormous plasticity that exists in its behavioral 
traits 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bronson1" TARGET="_top">Bronson, 1984</a>). In the case of nearly all other species, specific behaviors are 
highly defined by genomes, and adaptability to new environments can occur only 
slowly with changes in behavior as well as physiology and/or morphology driven by 
natural selection. In contrast, the house mice can disembark from ships in 
sub-antarctic islands or in equatorial Africa, and adapt immediately to survive and 
prosper. &#034;To be introduced into a radically new environment is one thing; to be able 
to reproduce there and so to establish a new population is quite another. The 
planet-wide spread of the house mouse in both manmade and natural habitats 
suggests an extreme reproductive adaptability, probably the most extreme among the 
mammals&#034; 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bronson1" TARGET="_top">Bronson, 1984</a>). Only humans are as adaptable (some would say less 
so).

<P>Thus, the defining characteristic of the species <i>M. musculus</i> is the decoupling of 
genetics and behavior. At some point during evolution, the ancestral house mouse 
population broke away from its previous behavioral constraints and once this 
occurred, the success of the species was assured. With men and women as 
chauffeurs and guides, the global conquest of the house mouse began.

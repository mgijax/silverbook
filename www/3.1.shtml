<a name="3.1"></a><H2>3.1 SOURCES OF LABORATORY MICE</H2>

<P>One of the unique advantages to working with mice, rather than other 
experimental organisms, is the availability of standard strains such as C57BL/6 
(abbreviated B6), BALB/c, and many others that are used in thousands of 
laboratories around the world each year. With the use of the same standard inbred 
strain, it is possible to eliminate genetic variability as a complicating factor in 
comparing results obtained from experiments performed in Japan, Canada, 
Germany, or any other country in the world. Furthermore, for the most part, results 
obtained in 1992 can be directly compared to results obtained in 1962 or any other 
year. But, where do these standard strains come from and how can one be sure that 
a mouse advertised as BALB/c is actually a BALB/c mouse?

<P>When two animals have the same strain name, such as BALB/c, it means that 
they can both trace their lineage back through a series of brother-sister matings to 
the very same mating pair of inbred animals. The breeding protocol through which 
these original progenitors became inbred is discussed later in this chapter. However, 
the important point is that unlike the world of computers, where there can be many 
independent imitation models of a standard such as the IBM PC, there is no such 
thing as an imitation BALB/c mouse. Two animals either have a common heritage 
or they do not. If not, they cannot share the same name. Thus, a strain name 
implies a history, and the histories of the traditional inbred strains are 
well-documented (see 
<a href="javascript:windowt31 = window.open('table3.1.shtml', 'windowt31', 'width=800,height=600,scrollbars=yes'); windowt31.focus()">Table 3.1</a>).

<P>A handful of US suppliers provide various strains of mice to researchers. 
Addresses and phone numbers for each are provided in 
<a href="a.shtml">Appendix A</a>; all will 
provide free catalogs upon request. 
<A HREF="a.shtml">The Jackson Laboratory</A> 
(or the JAX as it is commonly abbreviated) maintains an extensive mouse breeding facility with a very 
large collection of commonly used (and not so commonly used) strains for sale to other scientists.
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#12" TARGET="_top">12</a></sup> 
Their 1991 catalog lists hundreds of different inbred strains and 
substrains of many different types including all of the &#034;standards&#034; as well as newly 
developed strains and mice that carry various mutant alleles or chromosomal 
aberrations. Other U.S. suppliers have a more limited selection, but the largest of 
these &#151; 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Charles River Laboratory</A>, 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Taconic Farms</A>, and 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Harlan Sprague Dawley</A> &#151; may 
actually sell even more mice than the JAX. Each of these three companies stocks a 
set of common inbred strains &#151; including BALB/c, C57BL/6, C3H, DBA/2 and 
several others &#151; as well as hybrids and non-inbred strains. Two other U.S. 
companies &#151; 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Hilltop Lab Animals</A> and 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Life Sciences, Inc.</A> &#151; have more focused lists of 
strains with the latter devoted essentially to the sale of special athymic strains used 
in various immunological studies. All of these suppliers provide high quality, 
disease-free animals that are constantly monitored for genetic purity.

<P>Once a supplier has been chosen for a particular set of experiments, it is best to 
stay with that supplier for all future orders of mice. The reason for this is that even 
though all suppliers propagate their stocks with constant brother-sister matings, and 
B6 mice sold by JAX, Charles River, or Taconic can all trace their pedigree back to 
common founder animals, it is still the case that each independently-maintained 
line will slowly drift apart genetically from its ancestors and distant cousins. Most of 
the standard inbred strains sold by companies are derived from a genetic resource 
maintained by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The NIH inbred lines have 
been maintained separately from corresponding Jackson Laboratory lines since at 
least the early 1950s. The B6 strain was only at generation F32 when this separation 
occurred; by the beginning of 1994, the JAX strain had reached generation F187 and 
NIH-derived strains sold by Taconic and Charles River had reached generations 155 
and 160 respectively

The differences that have accumulated over this 
large number of generations may, or may not, have an impact upon the particular 
genetic characteristics of importance to any particular experiment, but it is critical to 
be aware of this possibility. To foster this awareness, independently-maintained 
inbred strains are given different &#034;substrain&#034; designations which follow the 
standard name and provide an account of past history. For example, the full name 
for the standard B6 mouse sold by the 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Jackson Laboratory</A> is C57BL/6J where J is the 
symbol for JAX. The B6 mice sold by both 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Charles River</A> and 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Taconic</A> have substrain 
symbols with multiple parts including N as an indication of their NIH derivation 
and BR to indicate that they are maintained in barrier facilities. Each supplier has 
also incorporated a sub-symbol that uniquely identifies the animals that they sell &#151; 
the full names are C57BL/6NCrlBR for B6 mice supplied by 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Charles River Laboratory</A> and C57BL/6NTacfBR for B6 supplied by 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Taconic Farms</A>.

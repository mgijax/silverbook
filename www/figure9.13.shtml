<B>Figure 9.13</B> 
The swept radius for experimental and framework linkage maps. 
The solid line indicates the <I>experimental swept radius</I> for sets of backcross animals that number between 20 and 100. 
The experimental swept radius should be used to evaluate the significance of experimentally derived recombination or concordance values. 
All experimentally determined recombination fractions or concordance values that lie below this line can be considered significant at a level of 95%. 
The broken line indicates the <I>framework swept radius</I>. 
This is a measure of the <I>actual</I> distance that a marker locus will sweep on each side with a probability of 95%. 
The framework swept radius should be used as a basis for choosing markers for setting up a framework map in a new linkage study. 
Recombination fractions (<I>rf</I>) that are less than 0.25 can be converted directly into 
<A HREF="glossary.shtml#centimorgan" target="_blank">centimorgan</A> distances through multiplication by 100 as discussed in 
<A HREF="7.2.shtml#7.2.2.3" TARGET="_blank">Section 7.2.2.3</A>. 
For larger recombination fractions, the Carter-Falconer mapping function should be used to obtain centimorgan distances 
(<A HREF="7.2.shtml#equation7.3" TARGET="_blank">Equation 7.3</A>). 
The experimental swept radius was derived through a reiterative Bayesian approach based on the use of 
<A HREF="9.1.shtml#equation9.6" TARGET="_blank">Equation 9.6</A>. 
The framework swept radius was derived by determining the recombination fraction having a 95% confidence interval with an upper limit equivalent to the experimental swept radius.

<B>Figure 9.14</B> 
Example of the coverage of mouse chromosome 2 with marker loci. 
The radius of each circle is equivalent to the swept radius around each locus as determined from 
<a href="javascript:windowf913 = window.open('figure9.13.shtml', 'windowf913', 'width=600,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf913.focus()">Figure 9.13</A>. 
With 52 backcross animals, four marker loci would be required to span the chromosome. 
With 72, a completely different set of three marker loci would be required.

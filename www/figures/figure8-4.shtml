<B>Figure 8.4</B>  
Length variation can be generated at tandem repeat loci by unequal pairing and crossing over. 
This Figure illustrates the general principle behind the generation of DNA variation at tandem repeat loci such as minisatellites and microsatellites. 
Individual repeat units are represented by boxes. 
The flanking sites "X" and "Y" allow detection of length variation at the locus, and correspond to nearest flanking restriction sites in the case of minisatellites or targets for PCR primers in the case of microsatellites.

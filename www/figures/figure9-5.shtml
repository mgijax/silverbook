<B>Figure 9.5</B> 
Maximum number of discordant strains allowable to demonstrate linkage. 
Data are extracted from Tables 1 and 2 of 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Neumann1" TARGET="_blank">Neumann (1990)</A> and are based on a Bayesian statistical analysis. 
A minimum of 13 strains is required, with zero discordance, to demonstrate linkage with a probability of 95%; a minimum of 16 strains is required, with zero discordnace, to demonstrate linkage with a probability of 99%. 
The two lines shown represent boundaries for the demonstration of linkage at each level of significance.

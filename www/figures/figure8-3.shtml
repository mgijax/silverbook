<B>Figure 8.3</B> 
RFLP generation by different molecular events. 
Chromosome 1 is the ancestral state, shown with three <I>Taq</I>I restriction sites (TCGA) and a fourth non-restriction site (TAGA). 
Chromosome 2 has undergone a C to T change (indicated by an asterisk) that destroys one of the restriction sites. 
Chromosome 3 has undergone an A to C change that creates a <I>Taq</I>I site. 
Chromosome 4 has had a 0.5 kb insertion. 
The boxed-in region on each chromosome is the restriction fragment that will be recognized on a Southern blot probed with the fragment indicated in the diagram.

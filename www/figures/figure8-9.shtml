<B>Figure 8.9</B> 
Detection of polymorphic loci with the RAPD technique. 
Corresponding chromosomes from B6 and C3H are indicated schematically as horizontal lines. 
Boxes on each line represent genomic fragments (RAPD loci) that can be amplified with a particular primer. 
Locus B is polymorphic. 
An illustration of the gel pattern that would be obtained with amplifiable products from B6 and C3H is shown.

<B>Figure 9.10</B> 
Determining the likelihood of equivalence for independently mapped loci. 
In this illustration, four different loci &#151; including a clone and three mutations &#151; have been mapped relative to the same 
<A HREF="../glossary.shtml#Anchor_locus" TARGET="_blank">anchor locus</A> in independent experiments. 
The type of cross used for mapping and the number of recombinants observed among the total number typed is indicated at the left of each two locus map. 
These numbers have been used to determine distance estimates, which are indicated by dark lines emanating from each locus symbol. 
The linkage data have also been used &#151; in conjunction with Tables 
<a href="javascript:windowtd2 = window.open('../tables/tableD2.shtml', 'windowtd2', 'width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowtd2.focus()">D2</A> and 
<a href="javascript:windowtd6 = window.open('../tables/tableD6.shtml', 'windowtd6', 'width=600,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowtd6.focus()">D6</A> 
&#151;to extrapolate minimum and maximum limits on the 95% confidence intervals associated with each map position. 
The confidence interval associated with the clone overlaps the interval associated with <I>Mut1</I>. 
This result suggests the possibility that the two loci may be equivalent although the minimal overlap observed would still make this a long shot. 
However, the data provide strong evidence against the possibility that the clone is equivalent to either <I>Mut2</I> or <I>Mut3</I>, which appear to map farther or closer from the anchor, respectively.

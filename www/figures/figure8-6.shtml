Restriction site polymorphism detection by PCR. 
In this example, primers have been chosen that are 200 bp upstream and 150 bp downstream of a polymorphic <I>Taq</I>I site. 
The initial PCR product amplified from both restriction site alleles will have the same length of 350 bp. 
However, the two alleles can be distinguished by subjecting the PCR products to digestion with <I>Taq</I>I and then fractionating the DNA by gel electrophoresis. 
At the right is an illustration of the ethidium bromide patterns that will be observed with each of the three possible genotypes.

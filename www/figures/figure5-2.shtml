<B>Figure 5.2</B> 
Mouse chromosome idiograms. 
Idealized representations of the Giemsa banding patterns associated with each chromosome in a normal karyotype. 
This figure was formed with electronic versions of individual chromosome drawings developed by Dr David Adler (University of Washington, Seattle) and is used here with his permission. 
Interested investigators can download these electronic files directly from the Internet Server maintained by Dr Adler. 
The server address is: Larry.Pathology.Washington.Edu 70. 
See

<I>See Dr. Adler's 
<A HREF="http://www.pathology.washington.edu/research/cytopages/idiograms/mouse/" TARGET="_blank">idiogram</A> of all mouse chromosomes on the web. 
Images of individual chromosomes are also available.<BR></I>

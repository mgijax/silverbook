<B>Figure 8.7</B> 
PCR-based detection of chromosome rearrangements. 
Each number represents the position of an oligonucleotide sequence that has been used to generate a PCR primer. 
In panel A, primers 1 and 2 will amplify a product only from the non-deleted chromosome, and primers 1 and 3 will amplify a product only from the deleted chromosome. 
The specificity of this last primer pair is based on the empirical observation of a maximum distance of &#126;1 kb beyond which PCR amplification is extremely inefficient under normal reaction conditions. 
In the three other panels, different combinations of primers can be used similarly to distinguish wild-type and mutant alleles.

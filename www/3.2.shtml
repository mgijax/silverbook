<a name="3.2.1"></a><H3>3.2.1 Outcrosses, backcrosses, intercrosses, and incrosses</H3>

<P>A formal classification system has been developed to describe the various types 
of crosses that can be set up between mice having defined genetic relationships 
relative to each other at one or more loci. For the sake of simplicity in describing 
these crosses, I will arbitrarily use a single locus (the <i>A</i> locus) with two alleles (<i>A</i> and 
<i>a</i>) to represent the situation encountered for the whole genome. With a simple two 
allele system, there are only four generalized classes of crosses that can be carried 
out: each of these is defined in 
<a href="javascript:windowt32 = window.open('table3.2.shtml', 'windowt32', 'width=500,height=250,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt32.focus()">Table 3.2</A> 
and described in more detail in the 
following discussion.

<P>At the start of most breeding experiments, there is usually an 
<i><A HREF="glossary.shtml#Outcross" TARGET="_top">outcross</A></i>, which is 
defined as a mating between two animals or strains considered unrelated to each 
other. In many experiments, the starting material for this outcross is two inbred 
strains. As described in the 
<A HREF="3.2.shtml#3.2.2">next section</A>, all members of an inbred strain are, for all 
practical purposes, homozygous across their entire genome and genetically identical 
to each other. Thus, an outcross between two inbred strains can be symbolized as 
<i>A/A</i> x <i>a/a</i>, and the offspring resulting from such a cross are called the 
<i><A HREF="glossary.shtml#F1" TARGET="_top">first filial</A></i> 
generation, symbolized by F<sub>1</sub>. All F<sub>1</sub> animals that derive from an outcross between 
the same pair of inbred strains are identical to each other with a heterozygous 
genome symbolized as <i>A/a</i>. However, when either or both parents are not inbred, 
as indicated in the second more generalized outcross mating shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowt32 = window.open('table3.2.shtml', 'windowt32', 'width=500,height=250,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt32.focus()">Table 3.2</A>, 
F<sub>1</sub> siblings will <i>not</i> be identical to each other.

<P>An outcross between two inbred strains or between one inbred strain and a non-
inbred animal that contains a genetic variant of interest is almost always the first 
breeding step performed in a linkage analysis. The F<sub>1</sub> animals obtained from this 
outcross can be used in two types of crosses commonly performed by mouse 
geneticists &#151; 
<i><A HREF="glossary.shtml#Backcross" TARGET="_top">backcrosses</A></i> and 
<i><A HREF="glossary.shtml#Intercross" TARGET="_top">intercrosses</A></i>. A mating between a heterozygous F<sub>1</sub> 
animal (with an <i>A/a</i> genotype) and one that is homozygous for either the <i>A</i> or <i>a</i> 
allele is called a <i>backcross</i>. This term is derived from the vision of an F<sub>1</sub> animal 
being mated "back" to one of its parents. In actuality, a backcross is usually 
accomplished by mating F<sub>1</sub> animals with other members of a parental strain rather 
than a parent itself. The two generation outcross-backcross combination is one of 
the major breeding protocols used in linkage analysis as described in detail in 
<A HREF="9.1.shtml">Chapter 9</A>. From Mendel's first law of segregation, we know that the offspring from a 
backcross to the <i>a/a</i> parent will be distributed in roughly equal proportions between 
two genotypes at any single locus &#151; approximately 50% will be heterozygous <i>A/a</i>, 
and approximately 50% will be homozygous <i>a/a</i>.

<P>A mating set up between brothers and sisters from the F<sub>1</sub> generation, or between 
any other two animals that are identically 
<i><A HREF="glossary.shtml#Heterozygote" TARGET="_top">heterozygous</A></i> at a particular locus under 
investigation, is called an 
<i><A HREF="glossary.shtml#Intercross" TARGET="_top">intercross</A></i>. The two generation outcross-intercross series 
was the classic breeding scheme used by Mendel in the formulation of his laws of 
heredity, and it is the second major breeding protocol used today for linkage analysis 
in mice. Again, according to Mendel's first law, the offspring from an intercross will 
be distributed among three genotypes at any single locus &#151; 50% will be heterozygous 
<i>A/a</i>, 25% will be homozygous <i>A/A</i>, and 25% will be homozygous <i>a/a</i>. The 
particular uses of each of the two major protocols for linkage analysis &#151; outcross-
backcross and outcross-intercross &#151; are discussed in 
<A HREF="9.4.shtml#9.4.3">Chapter 9</A>.

<P>A mating between two members of the same inbred strain, or between any two 
animals having the same homozygous genotype is called an 
<i><A HREF="glossary.shtml#Incross" TARGET="_top">incross</A></i>. The incross 
serves primarily as a means for maintaining strains of animals that are inbred or 
carry particular alleles of interest to the investigator. All offspring from an incross 
will have the same homozygous genotype which is identical to that present in both 
parents.

<a name="3.2.2"></a><H3>3.2.2 The generation of inbred strains</H3>

<P>The offspring that result from a mating between two F<sub>1</sub> siblings are referred to as 
members of the "second filial generation " or F<SUB>2</SUB> animals, and a mating between two 
F<SUB>2</SUB> siblings will produce F<SUB>3</SUB> animals, and so on. An important point to remember is 
that the filial (F) generation designation is only valid in those cases where a protocol 
of brother-sister matings has been strictly adhered to at each generation subsequent 
to the initial outcross. Although all F<SUB>1</SUB> offspring generated from an outcross 
between the same pair of inbred strains will be identical to each other, this does not 
hold true in the F<SUB>2</SUB> generation which results from an intercross where three 
different genotypes are possible at every locus. However, at each subsequent filial 
generation, genetic homogeneity among siblings is slowly recovered in a process 
referred to as <i>inbreeding</i>. Eventually, this process will lead to the production of 
<i>inbred</i> mice that are genetically homogeneous and homozygous at all loci. 
<i>The International Committee on Standardized Nomenclature for Mice</i> has ruled that a 
strain of mice can be considered &#034;inbred&#034; at generation F<sub>20</sub> 
(<a href="references.shtml#Committee1" TARGET="_top">Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice, 1989</a>).
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#13" TARGET="_top">13</a></sup>

<P>The process of inbreeding becomes understandable when one realizes that at 
each generation beyond F<sub>1</sub>, there is a finite probability that the two siblings chosen to 
produce the subsequent generation will be homozygous for the same allele at any 
particular locus in the genome. If, for example, the original outcross was set up 
between animals with genotypes <i>A/A</i> and <i>a/a</i> at the <i>A</i> locus, then at the F<sub>2</sub> 
generation, there would be animals with three genotypes <i>A/A</i>, <i>A/a</i>, and <i>a/a</i> present 
at a ratio of 0.25:0.50:0.25. When two F<sub>2</sub> siblings are chosen randomly to become the 
parents for the next generation, there is a defined probability that these two animals 
will be identically homozygous at this locus as shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowf31 = window.open('figure3.1.shtml', 'windowf31', 'width=400,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf31.focus()">Figure 3.1</A>. 
Since the genotypes of the two randomly chosen animals are independent events, one can 
derive the probability of both events occurring simultaneously by multiplying the 
individual probabilities together according to the "law of the product". Since the 
probability that one animal will be <i>A/A</i> is 0.25, the probability that both animals will 
be <i>A/A</i> is 0.25 x 0.25 = 0.0625 
(<a href="javascript:windowf31 = window.open('figure3.1.shtml', 'windowf31', 'width=400,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf31.focus()">Figure 3.1</A>). 
Similarly, the probability that both animals 
will be a/a is also 0.0625. The probability that either of these two mutually exclusive 
events will occur is derived by simply adding the individual probabilities together 
according to the "law of the sum" to obtain 0.0625 &#043; 0.0625 &#061; 0.125.

<P>If there is a 12.5% chance that both F<sub>2</sub> progenitors are identically homozygous at 
any one locus, then approximately 12.5% of all loci in the genome will fall into this 
state at random. The consequence for these loci is dramatic: all offspring in the 
following F<sub>3</sub> generation, and all offspring in all subsequent filial generations will 
also be homozygous for the same alleles <i>at these particular loci</i>. Another way of 
looking at this process is to consider the fact that once a starting allele at any locus 
has been lost from a strain of mice, it can never come back, so long as only brother-sister 
matings are performed to maintain the strain.

<P>At each filial generation subsequent to F<sub>3</sub>, the class of loci <i>fixed</i> for one parental 
allele will continue to expand beyond 12.5%.
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#14" TARGET="_top">14</a></sup> 
This is because all fixed loci will 
remain unchanged through the process of incrossing, while all unfixed loci will 
have a certain chance of reaching fixation at each generation. At each locus which 
has not been fixed, matings can be viewed as backcrosses, outcrosses, or intercrosses, 
which are all inherently unstable since they can all yield offspring with 
heterozygous genotypes as shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowt32 = window.open('table3.2.shtml', 'windowt32', 'width=500,height=250,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt32.focus()">Table 3.2</A>.

<P><a href="javascript:windowf32 = window.open('figure3.2.shtml', 'windowf32', 'width=550,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf32.focus()">Figure 3.2</A> 
shows the level of homozygosity reached by individual mice at each 
generation of inbreeding along with the percentage of the genome that is fixed 
identically in both animals chosen to produce the next filial generation according to 
the formulas given by 
<A HREF="references.shtml#Green2" TARGET="_top">Green (1981)</A>. After 20 generations of inbreeding, 98.7% of 
the loci in the genome of each animal should be homozygous 
(<a href="references.shtml#Green2" TARGET="_top">Green, 1981</a>). This 
is the operational definition of <I>inbred</I>. At each subsequent generation, the level of 
heterozygosity will fall off by 19.1%, so that at 30 generations, 99.8% of the genome 
will be homozygous and at 40 generations, 99.98% will be homozygous.

<P>These calculations are based on the simplifying assumption of a genome that is 
infinitely divisible with all loci assorting independently. In reality, the size of the 
genome is finite and, more importantly, linked loci do not assort independently. 
Instead, large chromosomal chunks are inherited as units, although the boundaries 
of each chunk will vary in a random fashion from one generation to the next. As a 
consequence, there is an ever-increasing chance of complete homozygosity as mice 
pass from the 30th to 60th generation of inbreeding 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bailey2" TARGET="_top">Bailey, 1978</a>). In fact, by 
60 generations, one would be virtually assured of a homogeneous homozygous 
genome if it were not for the continual appearance of new spontaneous mutations 
(most of which will have no visible effect on phenotype). However, every new 
mutation that occurs will soon be fixed or eliminated from the strain through 
further rounds of inbreeding. Thus, for all practical purposes, mice at the F<SUB>60</SUB> 
generation or higher can be considered 100% homozygous and genetically 
indistinguishable from all siblings and close relatives 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bailey2" TARGET="_top">Bailey, 1978</a>). All of the 
classical inbred strains (including those in 
<a href="javascript:windowt32 = window.open('table3.2.shtml', 'windowt32', 'width=500,height=250,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt32.focus()">Table 3.2</A> 
and many others) have been inbred for at least 60 generations.

<a name="3.2.3"></a><H3>3.2.3 The classical inbred strains</H3>

<P>During the first three decades of the twentieth century, a series of inbred strains 
were developed from mice obtained through the fancy trade (see 
<A HREF="1.1.shtml#1.1.2">Chapter 1</A>). A small 
number of these "classical strains" have, through the years, become the standards 
for research in most areas of mouse biology. The most important of these strains are listed in 
<a href="javascript:windowt31 = window.open('table3.1.shtml', 'windowt31', 'width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt31.focus()">Table 3.1</A> 
along with their uses, other characteristics, and the number of 
generations of sequential brother-sister matings that had been accomplished, as of 
1993, in the colonies of the major suppliers. Other characteristics relevant to the 
reproductive performance of many of the classical inbred strains are tabulated in 
<a href="javascript:windowt41 = window.open('table4.1.shtml', 'windowt41', 'width=640,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt41.focus()">Table 4.1</A>. 
Pictures of several classical and newly derived mouse strains are presented in 
<a href="javascript:windowf33 = window.open('figure3.3.shtml', 'windowf33', 'width=700,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf33.focus()">Figure 3.3</A>.

<a name="3.2.4"></a><H3>3.2.4 Segregating inbred strains</H3>

<P>A special class of inbred strains are produced and maintained by brother-sister 
mating in the same manner just described with one major exception. Instead of 
selecting animals randomly at each generation for further matings to maintain the 
strain, an investigator purposefully selects individuals heterozygous for a mutant 
allele at a particular locus of interest. This "forced heterozygosity" at each 
generation results in the development of a "segregating inbred strain" with the 
same properties as all other inbred strains in regions of the genome not linked to 
the "segregating locus". In almost all cases, segregating inbred strains are developed 
around mutant loci that cause lethality, severely reduced viability, or sterility in the 
homozygous state. Some mutant genes &#151; including 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96974" TARGET="_top">Steel (<I>Sl</I>)</A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:87853" TARGET="_top">Yellow (<I>A<SUP>y</SUP></I>)</A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:98472" TARGET="_top">Brachyury (<I>T</I>)</A>, and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:94929" TARGET="_top">Disorganization (<I>Ds</I>)</A> 
&#151; can be recognized through the expression 
of a dominant phenotype that allows direct selection of heterozygotes at each 
generation. With other mutant genes, heterozygotes cannot be recognized directly 
and must be identified by progeny testing or through closely linked marker alleles 
that are recognizable in the heterozygous state.

<P>At each generation of breeding, a segregating inbred strain will produce two 
classes of animals: those that carry the mutant allele and those that do not. Thus, it 
is possible to use sibling animals as "experimental" and "control" groups to 
investigate the phenotypic effects of the mutation in a relatively uniform genetic 
background. Segregating inbred strains are conceptually similar to congenic strains 
and the reader should read <a href="3.3.shtml#3.3.3">Section 3.3.3</a> for more information on the advantages 
and limitations of this approach to genetic analysis.

<a name="3.2.5"></a><H3>3.2.5 Newly derived inbred strains</H3>

<P>When the genomes of the traditional inbred strains were first analyzed with 
molecular probes during the 1980s, it became clear that their common origin from 
the fancy mouse trade had led to a great reduction in inter-strain polymorphism at 
many loci (as discussed in <a href="2.3.shtml#2.3.4">Section 2.3.4</a>). Since polymorphisms are essential for 
formal linkage analysis, crosses between the traditional inbred strains were less than 
ideal for this purpose. This problem could be overcome with the development of 
new inbred strains that were genetically distinct from the traditional ones. Another 
driving force in the development of new strains <i>from scratch</i> was the realization 
that none of the traditional strains were derived from a single subspecies or 
population; instead, they were all undefined genomic mixtures from two or more 
subspecies. Thus, the classical laboratory mice do not actually represent any animal 
that exists in nature. Although for many investigators, this would not appear to be 
an important problem, it is likely to become more relevant in future studies that are 
focused on the interactions among multiple genes rather than single genes in 
isolation. Within the traditional strains, unnatural combinations of alleles could 
have subtle unnatural effects on the operation of polygenic traits. To overcome this 
problem, new inbred strains are routinely derived from a pair of animals captured 
from a single well-defined wild population. Over the last several decades, inbred 
strains have been developed from animals representing each of the major 
subspecies in the house mouse group as well as somewhat more distant species that 
still form fertile hybrid females with <i>M. musculus</i>. Inbred individuals from 
<i>M. m. musculus</i> (CZECH II/Ei), <i>M. m. domesticus</i> (WSB/Ei, ZALENDE/Ei), 
<i>M. m. castaneus</i> (CAST/Ei), <i>M. spiciligus</i> (previously <i>M. hortulanus</i>; 
PANCEVO/Ei), <i>M. spretus</i> (SPRET/Ei), and the <i>faux</i> subspecies <i>M. molossinus</i> 
(MOLF/Ei) can all be purchased from the 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Jackson Laboratory</A> (see 
<a href="javascript:windowf22 = window.open('figure2.2.shtml', 'windowf22', 'width=720,height=580,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf22.focus()">Figure 2.2</a> 
for the phylogenetic relationships that exist among these various species and subspecies).

<P>The major hurdle that must be overcome in the development of new inbred 
strains from wild populations is <i>inbreeding depression</i>, which occurs most strongly 
between the F<sub>2</sub> and F<sub>8</sub> generations. The cause of this depression is the load of 
deleterious recessive alleles that are present in the genomes of wild mice as well as 
all other animal species. These deleterious alleles are constantly generated at a low 
rate by spontaneous mutation but their number is normally held in check by the 
force of negative selection acting upon homozygotes. With constant replenishment 
and constant elimination, the load of deleterious alleles present in any individual 
mammal reaches an equilibrium level of approximately ten. Different unrelated 
individuals are unlikely to carry the same mutations, and as a consequence, the 
effects of these mutations are almost never observed in large randomly-mating 
populations.
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#15" TARGET="_top">15</a></sup>

<P>Thus, it not surprising that during the early stages of mouse inbreeding, many of 
the animals will be sickly or infertile. At the F<sub>2</sub> to F<sub>8</sub> generations, the proportion of 
sterile mice is often so great that the earliest mouse geneticists thought that 
inbreeding was a theoretical impossibility 
(<a href="references.shtml#Strong1" TARGET="_top">Strong, 1978</a>). Obviously they were 
wrong. But, to succeed, one must begin the production of a new strain with a very 
large number of independent F<sub>1</sub> X F<sub>1</sub> lines followed by multiple branches at each 
following generation. Most of these lines will fail to breed in a productive manner. 
However, an investigator can continue to breed the few most productive lines at each 
generation &#151; these are likely to have segregated away most of the deleterious alleles. 
The depression in breeding will begin to fade away by the F<sub>8</sub> generation with the 
elimination of all of the deleterious alleles. Inbreeding depression will not occur 
when a new inbred strain is begun with two parents who are themselves already 
inbred because no deleterious genes are present at the outset in this special case.

<a name="3.2.6"></a><H3>3.2.6 F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrids</H3>

<P>The most obvious advantage of working with inbred strains is genetic 
uniformity over time and space. Researchers can be confident that the B6 mice used 
in experiments today are essentially the genetic equivalent of B6 mice used ten years 
ago. Furthermore, one can be confident that there will always be B6 mice around to 
conduct experiments on. Thus, the existence of inbred strains serves to eliminate 
the contribution of genetic variability to the interpretation of experimental results. 
However, there is a serious disadvantage to working with inbred mice in that a 
completely inbred genome is an abnormal condition with detrimental phenotypic 
consequences. The lack of genomic heterozygosity is responsible for a generalized 
decrease in a number of fitness characteristics including body weight, life span, 
fecundity, litter size, and resistance to disease and experimental manipulations.

<P>It is possible to generate mice that are genetically uniform without suffering the 
consequences of whole genome homozygosity. This is accomplished by simply 
crossing two inbred strains. The resulting F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid animals express <i>hybrid vigor</i> in 
all of the fitness characteristics just listed with an overall life span that will exceed 
that of both inbred parents 
(<a href="references.shtml#Green6" TARGET="_top">Green and Witham, 1991</a>). Furthermore, as long as 
there are both B6 mice and DBA mice, for example, it will be possible to produce F<SUB>1</SUB> 
hybrids between the two, and all F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrids obtained from a cross between a B6 
female and a DBA male will be genetically identical to each other over time and 
space. This particular F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid is the most common of those used and is available 
directly from most suppliers. All F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid animals are named with an abbreviated 
form of the female progenitor first, followed by the male progenitor and the "F<SUB>1</SUB>" 
symbol. The F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid generated from a cross between B6 females and DBA/2 males 
is named B6D2F1. Of course, uniformity will not be preserved in the offspring that 
result from an "intercross" between two F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrids; instead random segregation and 
independent assortment will lead to F<SUB>2</SUB> animals that are all genotypically distinct.

<a name="3.2.7"></a><H3>3.2.7 Outbred stocks</H3>

<P>A large number of the laboratory mice sold and used by investigators around the 
world are considered to be <i>outbred</i> or <i>random-bred</i>. Popular stocks of such mice in 
the U. S. include CD-1 
(<A HREF="a.shtml">Charles River Breeding Laboratories</A>), Swiss Webster 
(<A HREF="a.shtml">Taconic Farms</A>), and ICR and NIH Swiss 
(both from <A HREF="a.shtml">Harlan Sprague Dawley</A>). 
Outbred mice are used for the same reasons as F<sub>1</sub> hybrids &#151; they exhibit hybrid vigor 
with long life spans, high disease resistance, early fertility, large and frequent litters, 
low neonatal mortality, rapid growth, and large size. However, unlike F<sub>1</sub> hybrids, 
outbred mice are genetically undefined. Nevertheless, outbred mice are bought and 
used in large numbers simply because they are less expensive than any of the 
genetically-defined strains.

<P>Outbred mice are useful in experiments where the precise genotype of animals is 
not important and when they will not contribute their genome toward the 
establishment of new strains. They are often ideal as a source of material for 
biochemical purification and as stud males for the stimulation of pseudo-pregnancy 
in females to be used as foster mothers for transgenic or chimeric embryos. It is 
unwise to use outbred males as progenitors for any strain of mice that will be 
maintained and studied over multiple generations; the random-bred parent will 
contribute genetic uncertainty which could result in unexpected results down-the-road.

<P>If a stock of mice were truly random bred, it would be maintained through 
matings that were set up randomly among the breeding-age members of the 
population. Accordingly, matings would sometimes occur between individuals as 
closely related as siblings. In fact, most commercial suppliers follow breeding 
schemes that avoid crosses between closely related individuals in order to maintain 
the maximal level of heterozygosity in all offspring. Thus, random-bred is a 
misnomer; stocks of this type should always be called non-inbred or outbred.

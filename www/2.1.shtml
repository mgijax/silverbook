<P>To most people, all small rodents are virtually indistinguishable from each 
other, and as such, they are lumped together and considered to be mice of one kind 
or another. In <i>Webster's Third New International Dictionary</i>, one finds the 
following definition for a mouse: &#034;any of numerous small rodents typically 
resembling diminutive rats with pointed snout, rather small ears, elongated body 
and slender hairless or sparsely haired tail, including all the small members of the 
genus <i>Mus</i> and many members of other rodent genera and families having little 
more in common than their relatively small size&#034;.
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#6" TARGET="_top">6</a></sup> 
In fact, the order <i>Rodentia</i> (in 
the kingdom Animalia, phylum Chordata, and subphylum Vertebrata) is very old 
and highly differentiated with 28 separate families, numerous genera, and over 1,500 
well-defined species accounting for 40% of all mammalian species known to be in 
existence today 
(<a href="references.shtml#Corbet1" TARGET="_top">Corbet and Hill, 1991</a>). All families, subfamilies and genera in this 
order that contain animals commonly referred to as mice are listed in 
<a href="javascript:windowt21 = window.open('table2.1.shtml', 'windowt21', 'width=640,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt21.focus()">Table 2.1</a>. The 
family Muridae encompasses over 1,000 species by itself including mice, rats, voles, 
gerbils, and hamsters. Within this family is the subfamily Murinae, which contains 
over 300 species of Old World mice and rats, and within this subfamily is the genus 
<i>Mus</i>. The <i>Mus</i> genus has been divided into four subgenera, of which one is also 
called <i>Mus</i>. This subgenus contains all of the &#034;true Old World mice&#034; including the 
house mouse <i>M. musculus</i>, the main focus of this book. A humorous view of 
mouse evolution is reproduced in 
<a href="javascript:windowf21 = window.open('figure2.1.shtml', 'windowf21', 'width=700,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf21.focus()">Figure 2.1</a>, 
and a more serious phylogenetic tree 
with all extant members of the <i>Mus</i> subgenus is presented in 
<a href="javascript:windowf22 = window.open('figure2.2.shtml', 'windowf22', 'width=720,height=580,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf22.focus()">Figure 2.2</a>.
<P>There is still a great deal of confusion in the field of rodent systematics, and the 
proper classification of species into and among genera is now undergoing serious 
revision with the results of new molecular analyses. Just recently, it was suggested 
that the guinea pig is not a rodent at all, contrary to long-held beliefs 
(<a href="references.shtml#Graur1" TARGET="_top">Graur et al., 
1991</a>). And in other studies (based on DNA-DNA hybridization and quantitative 
immunological cross-reactivity), a series of African species known as &#034;spiny mice&#034; 
were found to be more closely related to gerbils than to true Old World mice 
(<a href="references.shtml#Wilson1" TARGET="_top">Wilson et al., 1987</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Chevret1" TARGET="_top">Chevret et al., 1993</a>).
<P>The major reason for the confusion is that classical systematics has always been 
dependent on taxonomy, and taxonomy has always been dependent on the 
demonstration of distinct morphological differences &#151; measurable on a macroscopic 
scale &#151; that can be used to distinguish different species. Unfortunately, many small 
rodent species have developed gross morphological characteristics that are 
convergent with those present in other relatively distant species. Thus, traditional 
taxonomy can fail to provide an accurate systematic description of mice. (An 
illustration of the close similarity of <i>Mus</i> species can be seen in 
<a href="javascript:windowf33 = window.open('figure3.3.shtml', 'windowf33', 'width=700,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf33.focus()">Figure 3.3</a>). 
Fortunately, the tools of molecular phylogenetics &#151; and in particular, DNA sequence 
comparisons &#151; have proven highly effective at sorting out the evolutionary 
relationships that exist among different mouse groups. With continued molecular 
analysis, it may be possible to clear up all of the confusion that now exists in the 
field. 
<P>Excellent sources of information concerning the systematics and phylogeny of 
<i>Mus</i> and related species are the proceedings from two conferences, <i>The Wild Mouse 
in Immunology</i> 
(<a href="references.shtml#Potter1" TARGET="_top">Potter et al., 1986</a>) and <i>The Fifth International Theriological 
Congress</i> 
(<a href="references.shtml#Berry2" TARGET="_top">Berry and Corti, 1990</a>) as well as a review by the Montpellier group 
(<a href="references.shtml#Boursot1" TARGET="_top">Boursot et al., 1993</a>). A concise description of <i>Mus</i> systematics is provided by 
Bonhomme and Gu&#233;net 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bonhomme6" TARGET="_top">Bonhomme and Gu&#233;net, 1989</a>).

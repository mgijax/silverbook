<a name="7.1"></a><H2>7.1 GENETIC MAPS COME IN VARIOUS FORMS</H2>

<P>The remaining chapters in this book will be devoted to the process and practice of genetic mapping in the mouse. Although mapping 
was once viewed as a sleepy pastime performed simply for the satisfaction of knowing where a gene mapped as an end unto itself, it 
is now viewed as a critical tool of importance to many different areas of biological and medical research. Mapping can provide a 
means for moving from important diseases to clones of the causative genes which, in turn, can provide tools for diagnosis, understanding, 
and treatment. In the opposite direction, mapping can be used to uncover functions for newly-derived DNA clones by demonstrating 
correlations with previously described variant phenotypes. Mapping can also be used to dissect out the heritable and non-heritable 
components of complex traits and the mechanisms by which they interact. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a primer on classical 
genetics and to give an overview of mapping in the mouse, with further details provided in subsequent, more focused chapters.

<P>In the prerecombinant DNA era, all genes were defined by the existence of alternative 
alleles that produced alternative phenotypes that segregated in genetic crosses. Today, with the use of molecular technologies, the ability to recognize genes has expanded tremendously. 
Monomorphic genes (those with only a single allele) can now be recognized through their transcriptional activity alone. Recognition of 
putative genes within larger genomic sequences can also be accomplished through the identification of open reading frames, flanking 
tissue-specific enhancers and other regulatory elements, internal splicing signals, and sequence conservation across evolutionary lines. 
Sequence-specific epigenetic phenomena such as imprinting, methylation, and DNase sensitivity can also be used to elucidate the existence 
of functional genomic elements.

<P>Mouse geneticists use the term <i>locus</i> to describe any DNA segment that is distinguishable in some way by some form of genetic 
analysis. In the prerecombinant DNA era, only genes distinguished by phenotype could be recognized as loci. But today, with the use of 
molecular tools, it is possible to distinguish &#034;loci&#034; in the genome that have no discernible function at all. In fact, any change in the 
DNA sequence, no matter how small or large, whether in a gene or elsewhere, can be followed potentially as an alternative allele in genetic 
crosses. When alternative alleles exist in a genomic sequence that has no <i>known</i> function, the polymorphic site is called an 
<i><A HREF="glossary.shtml#Anonymous_locus" TARGET="_top">anonymous locus</A></i>.

With an average rate of polymorphism of one base difference in a 
thousand between individual chromosome homologs within a species, the pool of potential anonymous loci is enormous. Classes of anonymous 
loci and the methods by which they are detected and used as genetic markers will be the subject of

<a name="7.1.1.2"></a><H3><I>7.1.1.2 Maps</I></H3>

<P>A <i>genetic map</i> is simply a representation of the distribution of a set of <i>loci</i> within the genome. The loci included by an 
investigator in any one mapping project may bear no relation to each other at all, or they may be related according to any of a number of 
parameters including functional or structural homologies or a pre-determined chromosomal assignment. Mapping of these loci can be accomplished 
at many different levels of resolution. At the lowest level, a locus is simply <i>assigned</i> to a particular chromosome without any further 
localization. At a step above, an assignment may be made to a particular subchromosomal region. At a still higher level of resolution, the 
relative order and approximate distances that separate individual loci within a linked set can be determined. With ever-increasing levels 
of resolution, the order and interlocus distances can be determined with greater and greater precision. Finally, the ultimate resolution 
is attained when loci are mapped onto the DNA sequence itself.

<P>The simplest genetic maps can contain information on as few as two linked loci. At the opposite extreme will be complete physical maps 
that depict the precise physical location of all of the thousands of genes that exist along an entire chromosome. The first step toward the 
generation of these complete physical maps has recently been achieved with the establishment of single contigs of overlapping clones across 
the length of two complete human chromosome arms 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Chumakov1" TARGET="_top">Chumakov et al., 1992</A>; 
<A HREF="references.shtml#Foote1" TARGET="_top">Foote et al., 1992</A>). By the time this book is actually read, it is likely that complete contigs across 
other human &#151; as well as mouse &#151; chromosomes will also be attained. However, it is still a long journey from simply having a set of clones 
to deciphering the genetic information within them.

<P>There is actually not one, but three distinct types of genetic maps that can be derived for each chromosome in the genome (other than the Y). 
The three types of maps &#151; <i>linkage</i>, <i>chromosomal</i>, and <i>physical</i> &#151; are illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf71 = window.open('figure7.1.shtml', 'windowf71', 'width=700,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf71.focus()">Figure 7.1</A> 
and are distinguished both by the methods used for their derivation and the metric used for measuring 
distances within them.

<a name="7.1.2"></a><H3>7.1.2 Linkage maps</H3>

<P>The <i>linkage map</i>, also referred to as a <i>recombination map</i>, was the first to be developed soon after the re-discovery of Mendel's 
work at the beginning of the 20th century. Linkage maps can only be constructed for loci that occur in two or more heritable forms, or 
<i>alleles</i>. Thus, monomorphic loci &#151; those with only a single allele &#151; cannot be mapped in this fashion. Linkage maps are generated by 
counting the number of offspring that receive either parental or <i>recombinant</i> allele combinations from a parent that carries two different 
alleles at two or more loci. Analyses of this type of data allow one to determine whether loci are &#034;linked&#034; to each other and, if they are, their 
relative order and the relative distances that separate them (see <A HREF="7.2.shtml">Section 7.2</A>).

<P>A <i>chromosomal assignment</i> is accomplished whenever a new locus is found to be in linkage with a previously assigned locus. Distances are 
measured in centimorgans, with one centimorgan equivalent to a crossover rate of 1%. The linkage map is the only type based on classical breeding 
analysis. The term &#034;genetic map&#034; is sometimes used as a false synonym for &#034;linkage map&#034;; a genetic map is actually more broadly defined to include 
both chromosomal and physical maps as well.

<a name="7.1.3"></a><H3>7.1.3 Chromosome maps</H3>

<P>The <i>chromosome map</i> (or <i>cytogenetic</i> map) is based on the karyotype of the mouse genome. All mouse chromosomes are <i>defined</i> 
at the cytogenetic level according to their size and banding pattern (see 
<a href="javascript:windowf51 = window.open('figure5.1.shtml', 'windowf51', 'width=450,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf51.focus()">Figure 5.1</A>), 
and ultimately, all chromosomal assignments are made by direct cytogenetic analysis or by linkage to a locus that has previously been mapped in this way. 
Chromosomal map positions are indicated with the use of band names (Figures 
<a href="javascript:windowf52 = window.open('figure5.2.shtml', 'windowf52', 'width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf52.focus()">5.2</A> and 
<a href="javascript:windowf71 = window.open('figure7.1.shtml', 'windowf71', 'width=700,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf71.focus()">7.1</A>). 
Inherent in this naming scheme is a means for ordering loci along the chromosome (see 
<A HREF="5.2.shtml">Section 5.2</A>).

<P>Today, several different approaches, with different levels of resolution, can be used to generate chromosome maps. First, in some cases, indirect 
mapping can be accomplished with the use of one or more <i>somatic cell hybrid lines</i> that contain only portions of the mouse karyotype within the 
milieu of another species' genome. By correlating the presence or expression of a particular mouse gene with the presence of a mouse chromosome or 
subchromosomal region in these cells, one can obtain a chromosomal, or subchromosomal, assignment (see 
<A HREF="10.2.shtml#10.2.3">Section 10.2.3</A>).

<P>The second approach can be used in those special cases where karyotypic abnormalities appear in conjunction with particular mutant phenotypes. 
When the chromosomal lesion and the phenotype assort together, from one generation to the next, it is likely that the former causes the latter. When 
the lesion is a deletion, translocation, inversion, or duplication, one can assign the mutant locus to the chromosomal band that has been disrupted.

<P>Finally, with the availability of a locus-specific DNA probe, it becomes possible to use the method of <i>in situ hybridization</i> to directly 
visualize the location of the corresponding sequence within a particular chromosomal band. This approach is not dependent on correlations or assumptions 
of any kind and, as such, it is the most direct mapping approach that exists. However, it is technically demanding and its resolution is not nearly as 
high as that obtained with linkage or physical approaches (see 
<A HREF="10.2.shtml#10.2.2">Section 10.2.2</A>).

<a name="7.1.4"></a><H3>7.1.4 Physical maps</H3>

<P>The third type of map is a <i>physical map</i>. All physical maps are based on the direct analysis of DNA. Physical distances between and within 
loci are measured in basepairs (bp), kilobasepairs (kb) or megabasepairs (mb). Physical maps are arbitrarily divided into short range and long range. 
Short range mapping is commonly pursued over distances ranging up to 30 kb. In very approximate terms, this is the average size of a gene and it is 
also the average size of cloned inserts obtained from cosmid-based genomic libraries. Cloned regions of this size can be easily mapped to high 
resolution with restriction enzymes and, with advances in sequencing technology, it is becoming more common to sequence interesting regions of this 
length in their entirety.

<P>Direct long-range physical mapping can be accomplished over megabase-sized regions with the use of rare-cutting restriction enzymes together with 
various methods of gel electrophoresis referred to generically as <i>pulsed field gel electrophoresis</i> or PFGE, which allow the separation and 
sizing of DNA fragments of 6 mb or more in length 
(<A HREF="references.shtml#Schwartz1" TARGET="_top">Schwartz and Cantor, 1984</A>; 
<A HREF="references.shtml#den_Dunnen1" TARGET="_top">den Dunnen and van Ommen, 1991</A>). PFGE mapping studies can be performed directly on genomic DNA followed by 
Southern blot analysis with probes for particular loci (see 
<A HREF="10.3.shtml#10.3.2">Section 10.3.2</A>). It becomes possible to demonstrate physical 
linkage whenever probes for two loci detect the same set of large restriction fragments upon sequential hybridizations to the same blot.

<P>Long-range mapping can also be performed with clones obtained from large insert genomic libraries such as those based on the yeast artificial 
chromosome (YAC) cloning vectors, since regions within these clones can be readily isolated for further analysis (see 
<A HREF="10.3.shtml#10.3.3">Section 10.3.3</A>). In the future, long-range physical maps consisting of overlapping clones will cover each chromosome 
in the mouse genome. Short-range restriction maps of high resolution will be merged together along each chromosomal length, and ultimately, perhaps, 
the highest level of mapping resolution will be achieved with whole chromosome DNA sequences.

<a name="7.1.5"></a><H3>7.1.5 Connections between maps</H3>

<P>In theory, linkage, chromosomal, and physical maps should all provide the same information on chromosomal assignment and the order of loci. However, 
the relative <i>distances</i> that are measured within each map can be quite different. Only the physical map can provide an accurate description of the 
actual length of DNA that separates loci from each other. This is not to say that the other two types of maps are inaccurate. Rather, each represents a 
version of the physical map that has been modulated according to a different parameter. Cytogenetic distances are modulated by the relative packing of 
the DNA molecule into different chromosomal regions. Linkage distances are modulated by the variable propensity of different DNA regions to take part 
in recombination events (see 
<A HREF="7.2.shtml#7.2.3">Section 7.2.3</A>).

<P>In practice, genetic maps of the mouse are often an amalgamation of chromosomal, linkage, and physical maps, but at the time of this writing, it is 
still the case that classical recombination studies provide the great bulk of data incorporated into such integrated maps. Thus, the primary metric used 
to chart interlocus distances has been the 
<A HREF="glossary.shtml#centimorgan" TARGET="_top">centimorgan</A>. However, it seems reasonable to predict that, within the next five years, the megabase will 
overtake the centimorgan as the unit for measurement along the chromosome.

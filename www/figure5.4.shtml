<B>Figure 5.4</B> 
Hypothetical region from the mouse genome. 
Illustration of a genomic region containing a four-member gene family. 
Each of these genes has the same underlying exon-intron structure as expected from duplication by unequal crossing over. 
One member of this family is no longer transcribed and is, thus, considered a pseudogene. 
Adjacent to three of the four members of this gene family is a non-functional sequence that must have come along with two of the duplication events. 
Given a sufficient period of evolution, these non-functional sequences will diverge into random unique sequence. 
Selfish elements have inserted into several sites including two that flank genes and two within introns.

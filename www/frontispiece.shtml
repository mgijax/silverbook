The frontispiece shows the &#034;Live Linkage Map of the Mouse,&#034; 
an exhibit presented by the staff of the Jackson Laboratory at the 
Tenth International Congress of Genetics held at McGill University in 
Montreal, Canada, August 20-27, 1958. A portion of the exhibit with 
five of the twenty mouse chromosomes is shown. Each chromosome is 
represented &#034;at a magnification of approximately 25,000&#034; 
by a vertical ruler-like line. Each locus known at the time of the 
Congress is represented with a cage of mice containing animals with 
the defining mutation. The text accompanying the exhibit states: 
&#034;This exhibit is designed to show how far we have come 
[in developing a mouse linkage map] and also to give an idea of the 
job remaining to be done.&#034; By October 1994, over 8,000 independent 
loci had been mapped onto the mouse genome. The author wishes to express 
his deep gratitude to Douglas Macbeth at the Jackson Laboratory for his 
continued persistence in locating this archival material.

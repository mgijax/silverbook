<a name="4.3"></a><H2>4.3 MATING AND PREGNANCY</H2>

<a name="4.3.1"></a><H3>4.3.1 Puberty</H3>

<P>The onset of puberty &#151; when ovulation first occurs in a female, and when males 
have achieved full spermatogenic activity &#151; is variable even among different 
animals within the same inbred strain. Although it is possible for some outbred 
females to reach puberty by the age of 4 weeks, the majority of females from most 
inbred strains first ovulate naturally between 6 and 8 weeks after birth 
(<a href="javascript:windowt41 = window.open('table4.1.shtml', 'windowt41', 'width=640,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt41.focus()">Table 4.1</A>). 
Numerous environmental factors appear to have an effect on the timing of 
this event 
(<a href="references.shtml#Whittingham1" TARGET="_top">Whittingham and Wood, 1983</a>). Exposure to adult males or their urine 
can bring it on sooner, whereas adult females or their urine may retard its onset. 
Furthermore, 3-6-week-old females can be induced to ovulate with a specific 
regimen of hormone treatment as described in 
<a href="6.2.shtml#6.2.2.1">Section 6.2.2.1</a>. The onset of male 
puberty in most laboratory strains usually occurs between 34 and 38 days, however, 
it is sometimes possible for non-inbred males to reach sexual maturity by 30-32 days 
after birth. Thus, if one does not want littermates to mate with each other, they 
should be separated according to sex before the appropriate age is reached.

<a name="4.3.2"></a><H3>4.3.2 The estrus cycle</H3>

<P>The normal estrus cycle of a laboratory mouse is 4-6 days in length. The 
cycle has been divided into four phases which are distinguished by changes in 
physiology, morphology, and behavior. (1) The <i>proestrus</i> portion of the cycle begins 
when a new batch of eggs reach maturity within ovarian follicles that are ripe and 
large. External examination of the female will usually show a bloated vulva with an 
open vagina. (2) <i>Estrus</i> begins with the ovulation of fully mature oocytes. The 
vulva remains in an extended state with an open vagina, and females are 
maximally receptive to male advances. When mice are maintained on a standard 
light-dark cycle, the estrus phase will usually begin soon after midnight and last for 
6-8 hours. (3) The <i>metestrus</i> phase follows, when mature eggs move through the 
oviducts and into the uterus. The vulva is no longer bloated, and the vagina is now 
closed.
 
<P>At the end of metestrus, a physiological branch point occurs with the direction to 
be taken dependent on whether a successful copulation has occurred. The act of 
successful copulation induces hormonal changes that prepare the uterus for a 
pregnancy which will ensue under normal circumstances. However, a sterile 
copulation &#151; one that does not lead to fertilization &#151; can induce a state of 
pseudopregnancy (see <a href="6.2.shtml#6.2.3">Section 6.2.3</a>). A pseudopregnancy can extend the <i>metestrus</i> 
phase by as long as 10-13 days. 

<P>(4) If pregnancy does not occur, the metestrus phase is ultimately followed by the 
last phase of the estrus cycle, <i>diestrus</i>. Unfertilized eggs are eliminated, the vagina 
and vulva are at a minimum size, and new follicles begin to undergo a rapid growth 
for the next ovulation. (The proestrus and estrus phases together constitute the 
<i>follicular</i> phase; the metestrus and diestrus phases together constitute the <i>luteal</i> 
phase.)

<a name="4.3.3"></a><H3>4.3.3 Mating</H3>

<P>Once animals have been together for more than a few days, mating will be 
restricted to the late proestrus/early estrus portion of the female cycle. It is only 
during this period that a female will be receptive and that a male will normally be 
interested. (However, in some instances, when a new couple is first brought 
together in a cage, the male will rape his partner, irrespective of her estrus phase). 
Mating typically occurs over a period of 15-60 minutes with clear strain-specific 
differences: DBA males are quick (20 minutes) and BALB/c males are slow (one 
hour) according to 
<a href="references.shtml#Wimer1" TARGET="_top">Wimer and Fuller (1966</a>). 
The male first examines the female 
genitalia and then mounts his mate and withdraws from one to one hundred times 
until ejaculation occurs during a final mounting. The male is quiet for a short 
period of time and then resumes normal activity. Although a full sperm count is 
not built up again for two days, it is possible for a male, especially an outbred one, to 
mate with up to three females in a single night, causing all to become pregnant. 
Different inbred strains have very different average times for recovery of libido, 
defined operationally as the time between attempted matings. DBA/2 mice can 
mate again within 1 hour, whereas B6 males usually wait for 4 days 
(<a href="references.shtml#Wimer1" TARGET="_top">Wimer and Fuller, 1966</a>).

<P>In some instances, one may want to maximize the rapid output of offspring from 
a single male. This situation could arise with rare genotypes such as new mutants 
or first generation transgenic founders. For this purpose, a single male can be 
rotated among sets of females (two or three per cage) in three or four cages. The 
factors that play a role in the length of each rotation have just been discussed: the 
length of the estrus cycle, the time it takes for a male to recover a full sperm count, 
and the libido recovery time. Together, these factors suggest an optimal rotation 
period of 4 days in each cage. For full optimization of offspring output, a male 
should receive two new, 8-week-old, virgin females in his cage, every 4 days.

<a name="4.3.4"></a><H3>4.3.4 Fertilization</H3>

<P>Fertilization takes place in the upper reaches of the oviduct (a region referred to 
as the ampulla). The egg remains viable for 10-15 hours after ovulation, although a 
gradual aging process slowly reduces the probability that fertilization will occur. 
Fertilization causes an immediate activation of the egg and induces the completion 
of the second meiotic division, which leads to the formation of the second polar 
body within two hours.

<P>The actual process of fertilization can be divided into a series of highly ordered 
steps that lead ultimately to the joining of a single sperm cell with an ovulated egg 
(<a href="references.shtml#Wassarman1" TARGET="_top">Wassarman, 1993</a>). 
The first step in this process occurs with the binding of 
multiple spermatozoa to the zona pellucida, a thick extracellular coat that surrounds 
the egg. The association between the zona and the sperm surface triggers the 
acrosome reaction which affects an elongated sperm-specific membrane-bound 
organelle just below the surface that contains a specialized protease called acrosin. 
The acrosome reaction is a form of exocytosis that results in the complete loss of the 
plasma membrane overlying the acrosome in hybrid vesicles along with the outer 
acrosomal membrane. The acrosomal contents are released, and these allow the 
resulting &#034;acrosome-reacted&#034; sperm to use protease to digest its way through the zona 
pellucida to reach the perivitelline space between the zona and the egg plasma 
membrane. Finally, fusion occurs between the egg plasma membrane and the 
plasma membrane overlying the equatorial region of a single sperm cell. Fusion 
leads to the activation of the egg and the initiation of embryonic development.

<P>The ultimate fusion reaction is not species-specific and can occur between 
heterologous gametes when the zona pellucida is first removed from the egg. Thus, 
in general, the main biochemical barrier to cross-species fertilization appears to lie 
within the initial interaction between the sperm plasma membrane and the egg 
zona pellucida. The specificity of this interaction implicates the existence of specific 
complementary molecules on egg and sperm, referred to respectively as the &#034;sperm 
receptor&#034; and the &#034;egg binding protein&#034; or EBP. The sperm receptor has been 
identified as a specific zona protein called ZP3 
(<a href="references.shtml#Wassarman2" TARGET="_top">Wassarman, 1990</a>).
The identity of the sperm surface EBP is still under investigation with multiple candidates 
described to date.

<a name="4.3.5"></a><H3>4.3.5 Determination of copulation and pregnancy</H3>

<P>After a successful copulation has been completed, particular components of the 
male ejaculate will coagulate to form a hard <i>plug</i> that occludes the entrance to the 
vagina. The plug is a coagulum of fluids derived from both the vesicular and 
coagulating glands, and as such, it can be produced even by a vasectomized male. 
Usually the plug is visible through a simple visual examination of the vulva. In 
some instances, a probe will be required to detect a plug located further back in the 
vagina. The most common probe used for this purpose is a simple dental tool with 
a blunt end. &#034;Plugging&#034; should be performed as early as possible in the morning 
after a potential mating. By noon, some inbred strain plugs will begin to disappear, 
however, most will persist for 16-24 hours after copulation. Plugs formed by 
outbred mice can persist for several days.

<P>Later in the pregnancy, from 10-12 days postconception and beyond, it 
becomes possible to feel the maturing fetuses within the uterus by simple palpation. 
Pregnancy palpation is most readily carried out on older, multiparous females who 
have looser skin and are more accustomed to being handled. Right-handed workers 
should hold the female in the left hand (left-handers should hold the mouse in the 
right hand), with the thumb and forefinger grasping the skin behind the neck, and 
the smallest finger holding back the tail. The other fingers of this hand should be 
brought in behind the mouse to arch her forward. When the female is securely held 
by one hand and relatively calm, one should use the other hand to close down 
firmly on the abdomen close to the spine on one side at a time with the forefinger 
and thumb and then gently move the fingers out. Initially, a pregnant female will 
seem to have a string of beads on each side of her body. As development proceeds, 
these &#034;beads&#034; will mature into larger, more defined shapes. With experience, this 
method can be used to determine the gestational stage of a pregnancy to within a 
single day.

<P>It is possible to identify a state of pregnancy in young females by a simple visual 
inspection that does not even require one to handle the animal. The gestational day 
at which this becomes possible is greatly dependent on a number of factors including 
the age of the female, the number of fetuses inside, and whether she has given birth 
previously. For first-time pregnant females carrying large litters, tell-tale bulges 
from the center of her body can be detected by day 15. At the opposite extreme, older 
multiparous females with small litters never &#034;show&#034; in this way. Fortunately, these 
older animals are easier to palpate when a prenatal determination is required.

<a name="4.3.6"></a><H3>4.3.6 The gestational period</H3>

<P>The gestation period for the mouse ranges from 18 to 22 days. Different strains 
have different averages within this range but even within a single strain, and even 
for a single female, there can be significant differences from one pregnancy to the 
next. Many different factors can have an effect on the length of pregnancy. For 
example, larger litters tend to be born earlier 
(<a href="references.shtml#Rugh1" TARGET="_top">Rugh, 1968</a>), as is the case with 
humans as well. Non-inbred females tend to have shorter pregnancies then inbred 
ones, but this may be simply because they tend to produce larger litters as well as 
larger pups. Birth occurs most frequently between the hours of midnight and 4:00 
A.M. when animals are maintained under a standard light-dark cycle; however, it 
can occur anytime of the day or night.

<P>The gestation period can be greatly extended when the pregnant mother 
continues to nurse a previous litter. Prolongation up to 7 days is not 
uncommon, and birth can sometimes be pushed back by as many as 16 days 
(<a href="references.shtml#Gruneberg1" TARGET="_top">Gr&#252;neberg, 1943</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Bronson2" TARGET="_top">Bronson et al., 1966</a>).
This fact should be kept in mind when trying to count back from the day of birth to the day of conception in order to 
determine paternity for females in contact with sequential males.

<a name="4.3.7"></a><H3>4.3.7 Effects of a foreign male on pregnancy and pup survival</H3>

<P>The fertilized embryo is a free-floating entity in the female reproductive tract for 
the first 4.5-5 days of development. It is during this pre-implantation period that 
external events can play a role in determining whether a successful implantation 
will occur. Obvious disturbances to the mental health of the pregnant female &#151; such 
as erratic lighting, extremes in temperature or humidity, high noise levels, or 
insufficient food and water &#151; can cause a failure to implant. In addition, there is one 
other less obvious disturbance that is highly significant in the eyes of the female &#151; 
the introduction into her cage of a male other than the one with whom she had 
mated. If the foreign male is not genetically identical to her partner, he can cause a 
premature termination of the pregnancy through a mechanism which is almost 
certainly a hormonally induced block to implantation 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bruce1" TARGET="_top">Bruce, 1959</a>; 
<a href="references.shtml#Bruce2" TARGET="_top">Bruce, 1968</a>). 
This pregnancy block is also known as the <i>Bruce Effect</i> (after its discoverer) and it 
provides an obvious selective advantage by ensuring that females will use their 
resources only to raise offspring who carry the genes of the intruding male (who is 
presumably more fit since he has displaced the original mating male). With the 
previous pregnancy terminated, the female can quickly become pregnant again with 
her new partner.

<P>It is interesting that females do <i>not</i> recognize males from the same inbred strain 
as foreign 
(<a href="references.shtml#Bruce2" TARGET="_top">Bruce, 1968</a>). On the other hand, a pregnancy block is induced in nearly 
all other cases. These findings indicate that one or more genetic differences are 
responsible for the distinction between the original and the intruder male, but in 
addition, they clearly show that the genetic recognition system is highly 
polymorphic. Further studies with congenic and coisogenic strains have 
demonstrated conclusively that a major component of this recognition system is the 
highly polymorphic class I family of genes in the major histocompatibility complex 
(<a href="references.shtml#Yamazaki1" TARGET="_top">Yamazaki et al., 1986</a>).

<P>The Bruce effect has important implications for the management of a breeding 
mouse colony. Quite simply, if a mating event has occurred and one wants to 
recover live-born offspring from this mating, for the first 5 days that follow, the 
pregnant female should not be placed either into a cage with a foreign male or in 
contact with bedding that has been soiled by a foreign male. After this initial stage, 
there is no longer any problem. In fact, if one wishes to quickly set up a new mating 
pair, one should be sure to do it before the litter is born. If a foreign male is in the 
cage at the time of birth, he will normally accept the newborn pups. (Presumably, he 
&#034;thinks&#034; these pups are his own.) On the other hand, if a male is placed into a new 
cage that already has newborn pups, he is likely to kill them (&#034;knowing&#034; that he 
couldn't possibly have been the father).

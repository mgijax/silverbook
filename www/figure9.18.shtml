<B>Figure 9.18</B> 
Idealized distributions for the expression of a quantitative trait in two inbred strains and the F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid between them. 
In this example, the mean levels of expression for two inbred parental populations (<I>m</I><SUB>P1</SUB> and <I>m</I><SUB>P2</SUB>) are separable from each other by 16 standard deviations. 
Three examples of F<SUB>1</SUB> distributions are shown. 
The first F<SUB>1</SUB> distribution would be expected with a trait controlled by a series of P1 alleles that all show complete dominance to their corresponding P2 alleles. 
The third F<SUB>1</SUB> distribution would be expected with a trait controlled P1 and P2 alleles, that all show strict semidominace. 
The second F<SUB>1</SUB> distribution would be expected with more complex scenarios including incomplete dominance skewed toward one parent or a combination of quantitative trait loci that show different dominance relationships. 
Since each population is genetically homogeneous, the intra-strain variation in expression must be due to environmental effects or change. 
In actuality, very large numbers of animals would have to be typed to obtain distributions that so closely resembled the bell curves shown in this figure.

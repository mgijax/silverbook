<a name="9.2.1.1"></a><H3><I>9.2.1.1 Conceptualization and history of RI strains</I></H3>

<P>Although a handful of isolated recombinant inbred (RI) mouse strains were 
developed during the 1940s and 1950s, the importance of these genetic constructs 
was not appreciated by any scientist prior to Dr. Donald Bailey who first 
conceptualized their potential utility for linkage analysis while working at the 
National Institutes of Health in 1959 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Bailey3" TARGET="_top">Bailey, 1981</A>). Bailey realized that 
established sets of RI strains could provide an efficient alternative to the lengthy 
process of classical breeding analysis that was required at that time to map any newly 
uncovered locus. Bailey moved with his first set of eight RI strains &#151; the original 
CXB set &#151; to the Jackson Laboratory in 1967. In 1969, Dr. Benjamin Taylor, also at the 
Jackson Laboratory, took up the cause of the RI approach and set about developing, 
from several different pairs of progenitor parents, large sets of RI strains that are 
now standards for the mouse genetics community including BXD, BXH, AKXL and 
AKXD 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Taylor1" TARGET="_top">Taylor, 1978</A>;

These standard RI sets, and others listed in 
<a href="javascript:windowt93 = window.open('../tables/table9-3.shtml', 'windowt93', 'width=600,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt93.focus()">Table 9.3</A> 
under JAX availability, can be purchased directly &#151; in the form of either 
animals or DNA &#151; from the 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Jackson Laboratory</A>. Today, recombinant inbred strains 
represent a critical tool in the arsenal used to map mouse genes and the RI approach 
has made its way into the study of other experimental organisms as well such as the 
plant <I>Arabidopsis</I> 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Lister1" TARGET="_top">Lister and Dean, 1993</a>).

<a name="9.2.1.2"></a><H3><I>9.2.1.2 Construction and naming of RI strains</I></H3>

<P>The construction of a set of RI strains is quite simple in theory and is illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf94 = window.open('../figures/figure9-4.shtml', 'windowf94', 'width=720,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf94.focus()">Figure 9.4</A>. 
One begins with an outcross between two well-established highly 
inbred strains of mice, such as B6 and DBA in the example shown. These are 
considered the progenitor strains. The F<SUB>1</SUB> progeny from this cross are all identical, 
and thus in genetic terms, they are all interchangeable. F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid animals are bred to 
each other to produce a large set of F<SUB>2</SUB> animals. At this generation, siblings and 
cousins are no longer identical because of the segregation of B6 and DBA alleles 
from the heterozygous F<SUB>1</SUB> parents. As illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf94 = window.open('../figures/figure9-4.shtml', 'windowf94', 'width=720,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf94.focus()">Figure 9.4</A> 
for a single pair of 
homologs, each of the F<SUB>2</SUB> animals will have a unique genotype with some loci 
homozygous for the B6 allele, some homozygous for the DBA allele, and some 
heterozygous with both alleles. At this stage, pairs of F<SUB>2</SUB> animals are chosen at 
random to serve as the founders for new inbred strains of mice. The offspring from 
each F<SUB>2</SUB> founder pair are maintained separately from all other offspring, and just two 
are chosen randomly for brother-sister mating to produce the next generation. The 
same process is repeated at each subsequent generation until at least 20 sequential 
rounds of strict brother-sister matings have been completed and a new inbred strain 
with special properties is established.
<SUP><A HREF="notes.shtml#75" TARGET="_top">75</A></SUP>

<P>Each of the new inbred strains produced according to this breeding scheme is 
called a &#034;recombinant inbred&#034; or &#034;RI&#034; strain. Different RI strains produced from the 
same pair of progenitor strains are considered members of the same &#034;RI set.&#034; Each 
RI strain is named with an uninterrupted string of uppercase letters and numbers 
that can be broken down into the following components: (1) a shortened version of 
the maternal progenitor strain name; (2) the uppercase letter &#034;X&#034;; (3) a shortened 
version of the paternal progenitor strain name; and (4) a hyphen and a number to 
distinguish each strain from all other strains in the same RI set.
<SUP><A HREF="notes.shtml#76" TARGET="_top">76</A></SUP> 
The first three components of an RI strain name are also used alone as the name for the 
corresponding RI set.

<P><a href="javascript:windowt93 = window.open('../tables/table9-3.shtml', 'windowt93', 'width=600,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt93.focus()">Table 9.3</A>
lists the 17 RI sets that have been used to a significant degree by 
members of the mouse genetics community (R.W. Elliott, personal 
communication). The most readily available of these are the ones that can be 
purchased directly from the 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Jackson Laboratory</A> (JAX) in the form of live animals or 
DNA &#151; fourteen RI sets with a total of 187 strains. The best-known and most well-
characterized RI set is BXD with 26 extant strains formed from an initial cross 
between B6 females and DBA/2J males. Individual strains within this set are called 
BXD-1, BXD-2, BXD-5 and so on. (The BXD-3, BXD-4 and other missing strains are 
now extinct and their numbers have been retired.) By August of 1993, 818 loci had 
been typed on the BXD set. Unfortunately, as discussed earlier in this book (Sections 
<a href="2-3.shtml#2.3.4">2.3.4</a> and 
<a href="3-2.shtml#3.2.2">3.2.2</a>), 
the two progenitors of the BXD set &#151; B6 and DBA &#151; are related to 
each other through the common group of founder animals used to develop most of 
the classical inbred strains at the beginning of the twentieth century. As a 
consequence, a significant number of loci will show no variation between the two 
progenitors even with highly sensitive PCR protocols that detect SSCPs and 
microsatellites (see 
<a href="8-3.shtml">Section 8.3</a>).

<P>More recently, two progenitor mouse strains &#151; A/J and C57BL/6J &#151; known to 
differ in susceptibility to over 30 infectious or chronic diseases were used to establish 
a new pair of RI sets &#151; AXB and BXA &#151; based on reciprocal crosses 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Marshall2" TARGET="_top">Marshall et al., 1992</A>). 
Genetic surveys suggest that these progenitors are much less related to each 
other than B6 is to DBA, and with 31 genetically validated extant strains
<SUP><A HREF="notes.shtml#77" TARGET="_top">77</A></SUP> 
available from the 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Jackson Laboratory</A>, this paired set is the largest, and likely to be the most 
useful for both linkage analysis and the study of complex traits that differ between 
the two progenitors.

<P>At any time, it is possible to add to the numbers of strains in a particular RI set by 
starting from scratch with a new cross between the original progenitor strains and 
following it through twenty generations of inbreeding. In this manner, J. Hilgers at 
the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam and L. Mobraaten at the Jackson 
Laboratory have increased the size of the original CXB RI set with five and six new 
strains, respectively.

<a name="9.2.1.3"></a><H3><I>9.2.1.3 The special properties of RI strains</I></H3>

<P>Like all inbred strains, RI strains are fixed to homozygosity at essentially all loci.
<SUP><A HREF="notes.shtml#78" TARGET="_top">78</A></SUP> 
Thus, the genomic constitution of each strain can be maintained indefinitely by 
continued brother-sister matings, and the strain can be expanded into as many 
animals as required at any time. However, unlike the classical inbred strains, the 
genotype of an RI strain is greatly circumscribed. First, there are only two choices for 
the allele that can be present at each locus: thus, for every locus in every strain of the 
BXD RI set, only the B6 or the DBA allele can be present. Second, because there is 
only a limited number of opportunities for recombination to occur between the two 
sets of progenitor chromosomes before homozygosity sets it, complete 
homogenization of the genome can not take place. An illustration of this principle 
can be seen in 
<a href="javascript:windowf94 = window.open('../figures/figure9-4.shtml', 'windowf94', 'width=720,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf94.focus()">Figure 9.4</A>. 
In this hypothetical situation, one can see genomic regions 
that are already frozen at the outset of the F<SUB>2</SUB> intercross in two of the three incipient 
RI strains. The two fixed regions are circled and (in this illustrative example) are 
both homozygous for B6 genomic material in the two F<SUB>2</SUB> parents that will act as 
founders for the new BXD-102 and BXD-103 strains. At each subsequent generation, 
additional regions will become frozen in either a B6 or a DBA state. After 20 
generations of inbreeding, each RI strain will be represented by a group of animals 
that will all carry the same genomic tapestry with random patches from each of the 
two progenitors, as illustrated in the final row of 
<a href="javascript:windowf94 = window.open('../figures/figure9-4.shtml', 'windowf94', 'width=720,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf94.focus()">Figure 9.4</A>.

<P>It is this homozygous patchwork genomic structure that is the key to the power 
of the RI strains. This is because the boundaries that separate all of these genomic 
patches represent individual recombination events that are also permanently 
frozen. Every RI strain has different recombination sites distributed randomly 
throughout its genome. Thus, a set of RI strains can be used in essentially the same 
manner as the offspring from a mapping cross to obtain information on linkage and 
map distances. Like other mapping panels, it is only necessary to type each RI 
genotype once for a particular locus, and the information obtained from typing 
different loci is cumulative. The major difference, of course, is that the particular 
genotype present within each RI strain can be propagated indefinitely whereas 
different offspring from a mapping cross will all have unique genotypes and finite 
life spans. Thus, there is no limit to the number of loci that can be typed within an 
RI strain. Furthermore, in the case of complex phenotypic variation, one can 
actually sample the same genotype multiple times to demonstrate instances of 
incomplete 
<A HREF="../glossary.shtml#Penetrance" TARGET="_top">penetrance</A> or variable

<a name="9.2.2"></a><H3>9.2.2 Using RI strains to determine linkage</H3>

<a name="9.2.2.1"></a><H3><I>9.2.2.1 Strain distribution patterns</I></H3>

<P>The major use of RI strains by mouse geneticists today is as a tool to determine 
linkage and map positions for newly derived DNA clones. As the first step in this 
process, an investigator should survey the progenitor strains for all the most useful 
RI sets to determine which of these sets can be typed for the presence of alternative 
alleles. The strains to be surveyed should include AKR/J, DBA/2J, C57L/J, A/J, 
C57BL/6J, C3H/HeJ, BALB/cJ, NZB/B1NJ, SM/J and SWR/J (see 
<a href="javascript:windowt93 = window.open('../tables/table9-3.shtml', 'windowt93', 'width=600,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt93.focus()">Table 9.3</A>). 
If one is 
trying to map a newly cloned gene, it is possible to start a polymorphism search 
based on the detection of RFLPs among DNA samples digested with one of several 
different enzymes 
(<a href="8-2.shtml">Section 8.2</a>). However, as discussed at length in 
<a href="8-3.shtml">Section 8.3</a>, one is 
much more likely to uncover polymorphisms with a PCR-based protocol like 
SSCP.
<SUP><A HREF="notes.shtml#79" TARGET="_top">79</A></SUP>

<P>Once alternative alleles at a locus have been distinguished for the progenitors of 
any RI set, one can proceed to type all of the strains in that set. The information 
obtained from such a single locus analysis will represent the 
<I>strain distribution pattern</I>, or <I>SDP</I>, 
for that particular locus. An isolated SDP in and of itself is usually 
not informative. One would expect approximately half of the strains typed to carry 
each of the progenitor alleles at random.
<A HREF="notes.shtml#80" TARGET="_top"><SUP>80</SUP></A> 
However, with a new SDP in hand, it becomes 
possible to search for linkage with each of the other loci previously typed in the 
same RI set or group of sets. This is most easily accomplished with a computer 
program such as Map Manager that compares the new SDP to each previously-determined 
SDP in the database, one-by-one, and applies a statistical test for 
evidence against or in favor of linkage 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Manly1" TARGET="_top">Manly, 1993</A> and see 
<A HREF="b.shtml">Appendix B</A> for further information).

<a name="9.2.2.2"></a><H3><I>9.2.2.2 Concordance and discordance</I></H3>

<P>The result of each pairwise comparison of SDPs is expressed in terms of the 
degree, or level, of <I>concordance</I> and <I>discordance</I>. When a particular RI strain has 
alleles from the same progenitor at two defined loci, the loci are considered to be 
&#034;concordant&#034; within that strain. When the alleles at the two loci come from the 
two different progenitors, they are considered to be &#034;discordant&#034;. The probability of 
discordance is a function of the linkage distance that separates the two loci under 
analysis. This is easy to understand in terms of the likelihood that two loci will be 
retained, by chance, within the same genomic patch as illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf94 = window.open('../figures/figure9-4.shtml', 'windowf94', 'width=720,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf94.focus()">Figure 9.4</A>. 
At one extreme, unlinked loci &#151; which can not possibly lie in the same genomic patch &#151; 
will be just as likely to have alleles from the same progenitor, by chance, as from the 
two different progenitors. Thus, one would predict that &#126;50% of the strains within 
an RI set will show concordance for a pair of unlinked loci. At the other extreme, 
loci that are very closely linked will always be in the same genomic patch, which is 
equivalent to saying that 100% of RI strains will show concordance (or 0% will show 
discordance). Between these two extremes will be loci that are linked, but less 
closely so. As the distance between two loci increases, the probability of discordance 
will increase in a calculable manner from 0% up to 50%.

<P>Whenever one accumulates data on multiple RI strains, it is useful to express 
this information in terms of concordance and discordance rather than in terms of 
actual genotypes. The terms <I>N</I> and <I>i</I> are used, respectively, to denote the total 
number of strains typed and the number of discordant strains observed. The fraction 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm7 = window.open('../figures/rhat.shtml', 'windowm7', 'width=400,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm7.focus()">R hat</A></I> 
&#061; <I>i/N</I> is used to denote the observed level of discordance. With the use of these 
terms, one can combine the data obtained from all sets of RI strains that show 
variation between progenitors for both loci under analysis. This can be 
accomplished even if different allele pairs are present in different RI sets. For 
example, at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95904" TARGET="_top"><I>H-2K</I></A> 
locus, B6 has a <I>b</I> allele, DBA has a <I>d</I> allele, and AKR/J and A/J 
both have a <I>k</I> allele; even so, one can still combine 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95904" TARGET="_top"><I>H-2K</I></A> 
data obtained from the BXD, AKXD, and AXB/BXA RI sets. If these three RI sets also show progenitor 
variation at another locus thought to be linked to 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95904" TARGET="_top"><I>H-2K</I></A>, 
then one can count up the 
number of strains discordant between these two loci (<I>i</I>) and divide by the total 
number of strains (<I>N</I> = 82) to obtain the observed discordant fraction 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm7 = window.open('../figures/rhat.shtml', 'windowm7', 'width=400,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm7.focus()">R hat</A></I>. 
When strains from multiple RI sets are combined for analysis in this manner, they will be 
referred to as an &#034;RI group.&#034; Increasing the size of the RI group can have dramatic 
effects on the sensitivity and resolution with which it is possible to determine 
linkage and map distances, as described in the following subsections and depicted in 
<a href="javascript:windowf95 = window.open('../figures/figure9-5.shtml', 'windowf95', 'width=600,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf95.focus()">Figure 9.5</A> and Tables

<a name="9.2.2.3"></a><H3><I>9.2.2.3 Demonstrating linkage: statistical approaches</I></H3>

<P>What degree of concordance between two SDPs is required to demonstrate 
linkage? The problem of distinguishing a chance fluctuation above the 50% 
concordance expected with unlinked loci from a significant departure indicative of 
linkage was discussed in more general terms earlier in this chapter. Suffice it to say 
here that prior to 1986, researchers did not fully appreciate the more stringent 
requirements imposed by the Bayesian statistical approach and were misled by 
concordance values that passed traditional 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=450,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
tests for significance. Mathematical formulations aimed at rectifying this situation were begun by 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Silver2" TARGET="_top">J. Silver (1986)</A> and 
were supplemented by Neumann 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Neumann1" TARGET="_top">1990</A>; 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Neumann2" TARGET="_top">1991</A>). In his 1990 paper, 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Neumann1" TARGET="_top">Neumann</A> published tables with a complete set of 
maximum discordance values (<I>i</I>) that are 
allowed for a demonstration of linkage at various levels of significance with data 
obtained from RI groups up to <I>N</I> &#061; 100 in size. Data from these tables have been 
extracted and shown graphically in 
<a href="javascript:windowf95 = window.open('../figures/figure9-5.shtml', 'windowf95', 'width=600,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf95.focus()">Figure 9.5</A>.

<P>With the maximum allowable discordant values that have been determined, it is 
possible to estimate the maximum distance over which linkage between two loci is 
likely to be demonstrated at a sufficient level of significance with an RI group of a 
particular size. This is a measure of the &#034;swept radius,&#034; which is a concept first 
developed by 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Carter3" TARGET="_top">Carter and Falconer (1951)</A>. 
The swept radius has been defined as the 
length of a chromosome interval on either side of a marker locus within which 
linkage can be detected with a certain level of significance. Although the swept 
radius was originally defined in terms of map distance, it can be readily converted 
into a measure of recombination fraction (with the use of an appropriate mapping 
function as described in 
<a href="7-2.shtml#7.2.2.3">Section 7.2.2.3</a>), which is more useful for direct analysis of 
raw data. In this way, the swept radius can be viewed as a boundary value for the 
recombination fraction. If the observed rate of recombination between two loci is 
less than the swept radius, linkage is demonstrated at a level of significance equal to 
or greater than the cutoff value chosen. If the observed rate of recombination is 
greater than the swept radius, linkage cannot be demonstrated with the available 
data.
<A HREF="notes.shtml#81" TARGET="_top"><SUP>81</SUP></A>

<P>The maximum discordance values allowed for each value of <I>N</I> can be translated 
into linkage distances (through the use of the Haldane-Waddington equation 
described in the 
<A HREF="#9.2.2.4">next section</A>) that describe swept radii at which linkage can be 
detected with a significance level of 95% or 99%. 
<A HREF="notes.shtml#82" TARGET="_top"><SUP>82</SUP></A>
With just 20 RI strains, one will 
only be likely to detect linkage with marker loci that are within 2 cM 
on either side of the test locus. The swept radius increases steadily as the size of the 
RI group climbs to 40 strains, where it becomes possible to detect linkage to markers 
that are within 7-8 cM of the test locus. However, even with 
an RI group of 100 strains, the swept radius is only 13-15 cM. In general, the distance 
swept by each marker locus in an RI group is only 40%-45% of the distance swept 
by each locus in a linkage analysis performed with an equivalent number of 
backcross offspring (see 
<a href="javascript:windowf913 = window.open('../figures/figure9-13.shtml', 'windowf913', 'width=600,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf913.focus()">Figure 9.13</A>). 
This disadvantage is offset by the easy 
availability of the major RI sets and the ever-accumulating number of marker loci 
for which SDPs have been determined as discussed further below.

<a name="9.2.2.4"></a><H3><I>9.2.2.4 Demonstrating linkage: a practical strategy</I></H3>

<P>From the preceding discussion, it should be clear that the chances of success in 
using RI data to demonstrate linkage for a test locus increase dramatically with both 
the number of strains analyzed and the number of evenly distributed SDPs that are 
already present in the database. As of 1993, several RI sets had been typed at over 200 loci 
(<a href="javascript:windowt93 = window.open('../tables/table9-3.shtml', 'windowt93', 'width=600,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt93.focus()">Table 9.3</A>), 
which, if randomly distributed, would fall on the linkage map at 
average distances of 7 cM or less from each other. The BXD set alone has been typed 
for over 800 loci. Even though these marker loci are not randomly distributed,
<A HREF="notes.shtml#83" TARGET="_top"><SUP>83</SUP></A> 
their overlapping &#034;swept diameters&#034; of coverage are sufficient to map most new loci 
that are typed among all members of this set. Furthermore, RI mapping panels 
become ever-more efficient at detecting linkage as each new SDP is added to the 
database. At some point in the near future, it is likely that SDPs will be determined 
for all 26 BXD strains at marker loci distributed across the genome at a <I>maximum</I> 
interlocus distance of 5 cM. At this point, every new test locus of 
interest will have to lie within 2.5 cM of a previously-typed marker locus, and thus, 
by simply typing the 26 BXD strains, one will be able to determine a map position 
with essentially 100% probability.

<P>Until the scenario just described is reached, it is best to maximize one's chances 
of demonstrating linkage by generating an SDP for the test locus over the maximal 
number of RI strains possible. Once data have been obtained and entered into a 
computer database, the first attempt to demonstrate linkage should be pursued at 
the highest stringency possible [equivalent to a Bayesian probability level of 99% in the 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Manly1" TARGET="_top">Manly (1993)</A> Map Manager program]. This will minimize the chance of 
picking up false linkages; if a positive result is obtained from such an analysis, one 
can <I>confidently</I> move on to the next task of determining a map position for the 
locus relative to the linked marker loci, as described in the next subsection. 
However, if this analysis fails to detect linkage, the stringency can be reduced further 
by small levels of significance in subsequent runs. A positive result obtained at a 
lower level of significance should be considered tentative and must be confirmed 
(or rejected) by incorporating more RI strains into the pairwise comparison between 
the test locus and the putatively linked marker locus, or through an independent 
approach such as somatic cell hybrid analysis 
(<a href="10-2.shtml#10.2.3">Section 10.2.3</a>), <I>in situ</I> hybridization 
(<A HREF="10-2.shtml#10.2.2">10.2.2</A>), or a backcross or intercross mapping panel (Sections 
<A HREF="9-3.shtml">9.3</A> and 
<A HREF="9-4.shtml">9.4</A>). 
Independent confirmation of just the chromosomal assignment alone, for example, 
can serve to increase dramatically the significance level for an RI-based 
determination of linkage to a particular locus on that chromosome 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Neumann1" TARGET="_top">Neumann, 1990</A>). Furthermore, the failure to detect 
linkage to many markers distributed over 
large regions of the genome can provide evidence for the exclusion of the test locus 
from these other regions. This information, in turn, can be used to increase 
significance levels in cases where the direct evidence in favor of linkage is somewhat weak 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Neumann1" TARGET="_top">Neumann, 1990</a>).

<P>In some cases, further evidence for, or against, linkage can also be obtained by 
comparing the SDP of the test locus to the SDPs associated with the two marker loci 
that putatively flank it on either side 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Neumann2" TARGET="_top">Neumann, 1991</a>). If the positioning of the 
test locus between the flanking loci is correct, one would expect to see mostly single 
recombination events among the three loci within individual RI strains. If the 
association of the test locus with this genomic region is false, one would expect to 
see a substantial number of double recombination events that separate the test locus 
from both markers. This type of analysis is most easily visualized in the form of a 
data matrix, discussed just below and illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf96 = window.open('../figures/figure9-6.shtml', 'windowf96', 'width=600,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf96.focus()">Figure 9.6</A>. 
It is important to 
point out, however, that interference does not operate in the formation of RI strain 
genotypes since the crossover events that produced each patchwork genome 
occurred over multiple generations. Thus, true double recombination events over 
short distances are not strictly forbidden; they are just less likely.

<a name="9.2.3"></a><H3>9.2.3 Using RI strains to determine map order</H3>

<P>Once linkage has been demonstrated among three or more loci, one can move 
on to the next step of determining their order along the chromosome relative to 
each other. This can be accomplished computationally with a program like Map Manger 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Manly1" TARGET="_top">Manly, 1993</a>), but it is also possible to carry out this analysis without a 
dedicated computer program. The first task is to set up an adjustable 2 x 2 data matrix 
of the kind illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf96 = window.open('../figures/figure9-6.shtml', 'windowf96', 'width=600,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf96.focus()">Figure 9.6</A>. 
This sample data matrix contains a subset of the 
actual data obtained with Chr 17 loci typed on the 26 RI strains present in the BXD 
set. Each row represents an independently determined SDP for the locus indicated 
at the left. Each column represents the complete genotype determined for an 
individual RI strain over the &#126;32 cM region that encompasses the loci shown. It is 
customary to order loci in the data matrix with the centromeric end of the 
chromosome at the top and the telomeric end at the bottom, when this information 
is known from other results.

<P>A new data matrix can be initiated for any set of SDPs that have been shown to 
form a linkage group. It is also possible to expand an established data matrix of 
marker loci with the inclusion of new test locus SDPs. At the outset, SDPs can be 
placed into the data matrix according to a first best guess of their genetic order 
relative to each other. If data are entered into a computer spreadsheet, one should 
manually shift the order of SDP-containing rows until an arrangement is found that 
minimizes the total number of recombination events within the whole data set. In 
addition, instances of triple recombination events over short distances in individual 
strains should be eliminated if possible. In this manner, it is often possible to arrive 
at an undisputed order for an extended series of loci as is the case, for example, with 
the eight loci from 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:894608" TARGET="_top"><I>D17Leh119</I></A> to 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:90691" TARGET="_top"><I>D17Leh12</I></A> and the eight loci from 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:90696" TARGET="_top"><I>D17Leh173</I></A> to 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:90699" TARGET="_top"><I>D17Leh23</I></A> shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowf96 = window.open('../figures/figure9-6.shtml', 'windowf96', 'width=600,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf96.focus()">Figure 9.6</A>. 
The computer program Map Manager will carry out 
this process automatically and will also allow manual adjustment of order when 
this is desired.

<P>There will sometimes be cases where two or more different orders appear equally 
likely. For example, in 
<a href="javascript:windowf96 = window.open('../figures/figure9-6.shtml', 'windowf96', 'width=600,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf96.focus()">Figure 9.6</A>, 
one could remove the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95742" TARGET="_top"><I>Glo1</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97584" TARGET="_top"><I>Pim1</I></A> loci from 
the position shown and place them instead between 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95914" TARGET="_top"><I>H2M2</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:90696" TARGET="_top"><I>D17Leh173</I></A>. Both 
placements require an unsightly triple crossover: in the position shown in the 
<a href="javascript:windowf96 = window.open('../figures/figure9-6.shtml', 'windowf96', 'width=600,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf96.focus()">Figure</A>, 
this occurs in strain BXD-12; in the new genetic position, this would occur in 
BXD-27. Both placements also require an equal number of recombination events so 
it is not possible to choose one order over the other based on the BXD data alone. In 
this case, other mapping data have been used to confirm the map order shown in the 
<a href="javascript:windowf96 = window.open('../figures/figure9-6.shtml', 'windowf96', 'width=600,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf96.focus()">Figure</A>.

<P>In general, determining map order with accuracy is increasingly more difficult 
with linked SDPs that are increasingly more discordant relative to each other. 
Increased discordance is indicative of increased interlocus distances, which make it 
more likely that multiple recombination events will have occurred along 
individual chromosomes; these will complicate the analysis. However, as is the case with 
all aspects of RI analysis, the more strains that are typed, the more accurate order 
determinations can become. For example, if SDP data obtained from the AKXL RI 
set had been considered in conjunction with BXD data, they would have provided 
unambiguous evidence in favor of the correct placement of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95742" TARGET="_top"><I>Glo1</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97584" TARGET="_top"><I>Pim1</I></A> proximal to 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:88515" TARGET="_top"><I>Crya1</I></A>, as shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowf96 = window.open('../figures/figure9-6.shtml', 'windowf96', 'width=600,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf96.focus()">Figure 9.6</A>.

<P>With the accumulation of large numbers of RI SDPs and a comprehensive two 
by two analysis for linkage, it becomes possible to build linkage maps that span 
many loci distributed over large chromosomal regions as illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf96 = window.open('../figures/figure9-6.shtml', 'windowf96', 'width=600,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf96.focus()">Figure 9.6</A>. 
By looking down any column, one can clearly see the genomic patches that derive from 
each of the two progenitor strains. At one extreme, four strains &#151; BXD-2, BXD-12, 
BXD-18 and BXD-25 &#151; appear to have fixed three separate crossover sites in their 
genomes leading to the presence of four alternating B6 and DBA genomic patches. 
At the other extreme, 12 strains &#151; including BXD-1, BXD-8, and ten others &#151; appear 
to have inherited this chromosomal region intact, without recombination, from 
either the B6 or DBA progenitor.
<A HREF="notes.shtml#84" TARGET="_top"><SUP>84</SUP></A> 
The remaining ten strains have fixed either one 
or two crossover sites leading to two or three genomic patches respectively.
 
<P>Through the visualization of RI data in this way, one can pick up suspicious 
results that may be due to experimental error. For example, the presence of a B6 
allele at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:98909" TARGET="_top">Upg-1</A> 
locus in BXD-22 requires a double crossover that encompasses 
only this locus and no others. One would be advised to go back and retype this 
locus on a new sample from this RI strain.

<P>By looking horizontally across the data matrix and comparing pairs of SDPs, one 
can visualize the degree of concordance that exists between nearby loci. At three 
separate junctures &#151; 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:90691" TARGET="_top"><I>D17Leh12</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95742" TARGET="_top"><I>Glo-1</I></A>, 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:98815" TARGET="_top"><I>Tpx-1</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96325" TARGET="_top"><I>Iapls1-3</I></A>, and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:88409" TARGET="_top"><I>Ckb-rs2</I></A>/
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96218" TARGET="_top"><I>Hprt-rs1</I></A>, 
the BXD RI data alone are not sufficient to demonstrate linkage according to the limits shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowf95 = window.open('../figures/figure9-5.shtml', 'windowf95', 'width=600,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf95.focus()">Figure 9.5</A>; 
in all these cases, data from other mapping experiments 
provided evidence of linkage between two or more loci present on opposite sides of 
these junctures. There are also numerous examples of loci that have the same SDP; 
as described in the 
<A HREF="9-2.shtml#9.2.4">next section</A>, loci with shared SDPs across only 26 typed strains 
can actually be quite distant from each other in terms of map distance (see 
<a href="javascript:windowf98 = window.open('../figures/figure9-8.shtml', 'windowf98', 'width=550,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf98.focus()">Figure 9.8</A>).

<P>The data matrix for this portion of Chr 17 also illustrates how the power of the RI 
approach to linkage determination increases with the number of loci that are typed. 
For example, the SDPs for 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:894608" TARGET="_top"><I>D17Leh119</I></A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96018" TARGET="_top"><I>Hba-ps4</I></A> are distinguished by four 
discordant strains (BXD-2, BXD-18, BXD-21, and BXD-25). Thus, according to 
<a href="javascript:windowf95 = window.open('../figures/figure9-5.shtml', 'windowf95', 'width=600,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf95.focus()">Figure 9.5</A>, 
these data alone do not provide sufficient evidence for linkage between these 
two loci at the 95% significance level. However, when the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97620" TARGET="_top"><I>Plg</I></A> 
SDP was added to the database, it provided the required evidence for linkage of 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:894608" TARGET="_top"><I>D17Leh119</I></A> to 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96018" TARGET="_top"><I>Hba-ps4</I></A> 
through their common linkage &#151; with 99% significance &#151; to the newly typed locus.

<a name="9.2.4"></a><H3>9.2.4 Using RI strains to determine map distances</H3>

<a name="9.2.4.1"></a><H3><I>9.2.4.1 From discordance to linkage distance</I></H3>

<P>As alluded to earlier in this section, when two loci are known to be linked, the 
level of discordance that is observed between their SDPs can be equated with a mean 
estimate of the distance that separates them. In fact, this distance estimate can be 
made even in those cases where the RI data alone are not sufficient to provide 
evidence for linkage. Thus, RI data are useful for estimating recombination 
distances between loci that have been linked by non-breeding methods such as 
physical mapping or cytogenetic analyses. However, it is not sufficient to simply 
determine the fraction of strains that show discordance and use this directly as an 
estimate of the recombination fraction. The problem is that during the generation 
of each RI strain, an average chromosomal region will have multiple opportunities 
to recombine as it passes through several generations in a heterozygous state (see 
<a href="javascript:windowf94 = window.open('../figures/figure9-4.shtml', 'windowf94', 'width=720,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf94.focus()">Figure 9.4</A>).

<P>Interestingly, long before the conceptualization of RI strains, 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Haldane4" TARGET="_top">Haldane and Waddington (1931)</A> 
derived a mathematical solution to this problem in the context 
of determining the probability with which a recombinant genotype would become 
fixed after successive generations of inbreeding. This solution was formulated in the 
following equation where <I>r</I> is the probability of recombination in any one gamete 
and <I>R</I> is the fraction of RI strains that are predicted to be discordant:<BR><BR>

<A NAME="equation9.7"></A>(Equation 9.7)<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/9-7.jpg" WIDTH="151" HEIGHT="72"><BR><BR>

<P>Equation 9.7 illustrates two points. First, the expected fraction of discordant 
strains is dependent on only a single variable &#151; the probability of recombination 
between the two loci under analysis. In turn, since interference in any one 
generation is nearly 100% over the distances analyzed by RI analysis (see 
<a href="7-2.shtml">Section 7.2</a>), 
the probability of recombination can be converted directly into a 
<A HREF="../glossary.shtml#centimorgan" TARGET="_top">centimorgan</A> 
linkage distance (<I>d</I>) with an <I>r</I> value of 0.01 defined as equivalent to one 
centimorgan. Thus:<BR><BR>

<A NAME="equation9.8"></A>(Equation 9.8)<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/9-8.jpg" WIDTH="98" HEIGHT="38"><BR><BR>

Second, for values of <I>r</I> that are smaller than 0.01, 
<A HREF="#equation9.7">Equation 9.7</A> can be 
approximated by the simpler <I>R</I> &#126;&#061; 4<I>r</I>. 
Thus, a 1 cM distance becomes amplified into a predicted discordance frequency of &#062;4%. As 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Taylor1" TARGET="_top">Taylor (1978)</A> pointed out, this 
four-fold amplification can be interpreted to mean that during RI strain 
development, a locus will be transmitted, on average, through four heterozygous 
animals (with four chances for a recombination event in its vicinity) before it is 
fixed to homozygosity.

<P>The amplification of the linkage map serves to enhance the usefulness of the RI 
approach in the analysis of closely linked loci. For example, in a group of 100 RI 
strains, recombination sites will be distributed at average distances of 0.25 cM, which 
is four times more highly resolving than that possible with an equivalent number 
of backcross animals. However, this same amplification has the negative 
consequence of limiting the usefulness of the RI approach in studying loci that are 
more distantly linked to each other. For example, at a distance of 25 cM (<I>r</I>&#126;&#061; 0.25), the 
predicted discordance level for RI strains would be 40% (<I>R</I> &#061; 0.4), a value which is 
perilously close to the 50% expected with unlinked loci. As a consequence, the per 
locus swept radius obtained with RI strains will be much less than that obtainable 
with an equal number of backcross offspring.

<P>In most cases of RI analysis, an investigator wants to go from a discordance 
fraction to an estimate of linkage distance. The experimentally determined 
discordance fraction 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm7 = window.open('../figures/rhat.shtml', 'windowm7', 'width=400,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm7.focus()">R-hat</A></I> 
&#061; <I>i/N</I>provides an estimate of the <I>true</I> value 
<I>R</I>, which is based on the 
<I>actual</I> probability of recombination <I>r</I>. By substituting 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm7 = window.open('../figures/rhat.shtml', 'windowm7', 'width=400,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm7.focus()">R-hat</A></I> 
for <I>R</I> in 
<A HREF="#equation9.7">Equation 9.7</A>, one can 
obtain a corresponding recombination fraction estimate 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm8 = window.open('../figures/smallrhat.shtml', 'windowm8', 'width=400,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm8.focus()">small r-hat</A></I>. 
This can be accomplished more easily if 
<A HREF="#equation9.7">Equation 9.7</A> is inverted to yield <I>r</I> as a function of <I>R</I> or, through direct 
substitution, 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm8 = window.open('../figures/smallrhat.shtml', 'windowm8', 'width=400,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm8.focus()">small r-hat</A></I> 
as a function of 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm7 = window.open('../figures/rhat.shtml', 'windowm7', 'width=400,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm7.focus()">R-hat</A></I>:<BR><BR>

<A NAME="equation9.9"></A>(Equation 9.9)<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/9-9.jpg" WIDTH="154" HEIGHT="81"><BR><BR>

Another useful formulation of this same equation allows one to obtain the 
estimated recombination fraction as a function of the sample size, <I>N</I>, and the 
number of discordant strains, <I>i</I>:<BR><BR>

<A NAME="equation9.10"></A>(Equation 9.10)<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/9-10.jpg" WIDTH="142" HEIGHT="68"><BR><BR>

Finally, a corresponding linkage distance estimate in centimorgans (
<I><a href="javascript:windowm9 = window.open('../figures/dhat.shtml', 'windowm9', 'width=400,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm9.focus()">d-hat</A></I>) 
can be derived by multiplying the 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm8 = window.open('../figures/smallrhat.shtml', 'windowm8', 'width=400,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm8.focus()">small r-hat</A></I> 
value obtained in 
<A HREF="#equation9.10">Equation 9.10</A> by 100.

<P>The graph in 
<a href="javascript:windowf97 = window.open('../figures/figure9-7.shtml', 'windowf97', 'width=600,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf97.focus()">Figure 9.7</A> 
provides a rapid means for determining a linkage 
distance estimate from values for <I>i</I> and <I>N</I> that are commonly obtained in RI 
analyses. Just place a ruler over the graph so that it crosses the experimental value 
for <I>N</I> along the top and bottom axes, then observe the point at which the ruler 
crosses the curve associated with the experimentally-determined value for <I>i</I>. From 
this point, look across to the Y axis to read off the linkage distance in centimorgans.

<a name="9.2.4.2"></a><H3><I>9.2.4.2 How accurate is the linkage distance estimate?</I></H3>

<P>Once a value for linkage distance has been obtained from RI data, the next 
question an investigator will ask is: how accurate is this value? The answer to this 
question will be critical to investigators who want to use RI data to evaluate possible 
relationships between the cloned gene they have just mapped and other previously 
mapped loci that are defined strictly in terms of a mutant phenotype. (A detailed 
discussion of the general strategy used to evaluate such relationships has been left to 
<a href="9-3.shtml#9.3.4">Section 9.3.4</a> and is illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf910 = window.open('../figures/figure9-10.shtml', 'windowf910', 'width=700,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf910.focus()">Figure 9.10</A>.)

<P>The accuracy of an experimentally determined value such as linkage distance can 
be quantitated in terms of a &#034;confidence interval&#034; which is defined by lower and 
upper boundaries &#151; called confidence limits. To calculate a confidence interval from 
a body of data, one must first choose the &#034;confidence coefficient&#034;, or level of 
confidence, that one wishes to attain. The confidence coefficient represents the 
probability with which the associated interval is likely to contain the value of the 
true recombination fraction or linkage distance. Each confidence coefficient will 
produce a different confidence interval.

<P>In general, two particular confidence coefficients are used most often for the 
evaluation of data obtained from sampling experiments aimed at estimating an 
absolute <I>real</I> value (like linkage distance). The first is based on the standard error of 
the mean:<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/ssubxbar.jpg"><BR><BR>

for a normal (bell-shaped) probability distribution around a mean value:<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/xbar.jpg"><BR><BR>

When the lower limit of the interval around a normal distribution is set at:<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/xbarminus.jpg"><BR><BR>

and the upper limit is set at:<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/xbarplus.jpg"><BR><BR>

the corresponding confidence coefficient is always equal to 68%. It is standard practice to display 
this confidence interval within a single term:<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/xbarplusminus.jpg"><BR><BR>

Twice as often as not, the 68% confidence interval will contain the true value being 
estimated; this interval provides an investigator with an overall sense of the 
accuracy of the mean estimate predicted from experimental data.

<P>As discussed at length in 
<A HREF="d.shtml">Appendix D</A> and by other authors 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Silver1" TARGET="_top">Silver, 1985</a>), data 
obtained from linkage studies based on small sample sizes and low levels of 
discordance are not well approximated by &#034;normal&#034; probability distributions (see Figures 
<a href="javascript:windowfd1 = window.open('../figures/figureD1.shtml', 'windowfd1', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowfd1.focus()">D1</A> and 
<a href="javascript:windowfd2 = window.open('../figures/figureD2.shtml', 'windowfd2', 'width=600,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowfd2.focus()">D2</A>). 
Unfortunately, the standard deviation does not provide an 
accurate measure of lower and upper confidence limits in the context of non-normal probability distributions 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Moore1" TARGET="_top">Moore and McCabe, 1989</A>, p.41). In its place, I 
have used more appropriate estimates for lower and upper confidence limits 
associated with an actual 68% confidence interval.

<P>The second confidence interval of critical importance for interpreting 
experimental data is one that encompasses the range of values likely to contain the 
<I>actual</I> recombination fraction with a probability of 95%. The more stringent 95% 
confidence interval is used often to define the generally accepted limits 
<I>beyond which</I> the actual value of <I>r</I> is unlikely to lie. A discussion of the statistical approach 
used to determine confidence limits for both RI strain and backcross data is presented in 
<A HREF="d.shtml">Appendix D</A> along with tables of minimum and maximum values for 
68% and 95% intervals. By interpolating between the numbers presented in either 
<a href="javascript:windowtd1 = window.open('../tables/tableD1.shtml', 'windowtd1', 'width=600,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowtd1.focus()">Table D1</A> or 
<a href="javascript:windowtd2 = window.open('../tables/tableD2.shtml', 'windowtd2', 'width=600,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowtd2.focus()">Table D2</A>, 
one can derive confidence limits for pairs of <I>i</I> and <I>N</I> values 
generated in an analysis of 20-100 RI strains.

<a name="9.2.4.3"></a><H3><I>9.2.4.3 What is the meaning of 100% concordance?</I></H3>

<P>One special case of RI strain results deserves particular attention &#151; when 
complete concordance is observed between the SDP patterns obtained for two 
different loci. In this special case, the Haldane-Waddington formulation (Equations 
<A HREF="#equation9.8">9.8</A> and 
<A HREF="#equation9.9">9.9</A>) leads to a linkage distance estimate of 0 cM. However, if 
the two loci under analysis were independently-derived and known not to be 
identical, an estimate of zero distance clearly makes no sense. Based on intuitive 
grounds alone, one would expect there to be a strong likelihood that the two loci are 
actually separated from each other by a significant distance, especially when the total 
number of RI strains typed is small.

<P>An accurate estimate of the median expected recombination fraction 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm10 = window.open('../figures/rbar.shtml', 'windowm10', 'width=400,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm10.focus()">r-bar</A></I> 
(leading directly to an estimate of the median expected linkage distance
<I><a href="javascript:windowm3 = window.open('../figures/dbar.shtml', 'windowm3', 'width=400,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm3.focus()">d-bar</A></I>) 
that separates two completely concordant loci can be obtained by determining the midline of 
the area under the associated probability density function as discussed in 
<A HREF="d.shtml">Appendix D</A> and illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowfd1 = window.open('../figures/figureD1.shtml', 'windowfd1', 'width=600,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowfd1.focus()">Figure D1</A>. 
The results of this calculation for the range of 15 to 100 RI strains are presented graphically in 
<a href="javascript:windowf98 = window.open('../figures/figure9-8.shtml', 'windowf98', 'width=550,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf98.focus()">Figure 9.8</A> 
along with upper limits for 68% and 95% confidence intervals. 

<P>As an example, consider the implications of these statistical formulations in the 
case of complete concordance between two SDP patterns for the set of 26 BXD RI 
strains. The median estimate of linkage distance between two concordant loci is 0.66 
cM (or 1.3 megabases based on a conversion of 1 cM to 2.0 mb). The 68% 
confidence interval extends from 0.2 cM to 1.76 cM (or 400 kb to 3.5 megabases), and 
the 95% confidence interval extends from 0.02 cM to 3.95 cM (or 40 kb to 7.9 
mb from the computer program presented in 
<A HREF="d.shtml">Appendix D</A>). These numbers 
confirm the intuitive suspicion that two concordant loci typed in only a small 
sample set probably do <I>not</I> map on top of each other.

<P>Although a small group of RI strains is not sufficient to demonstrate close 
linkage, this conclusion does become more appropriate as the number of concordant 
RI strains increases. With 100 completely concordant strains, the median estimate 
of linkage distance is reduced to 0.17 cM or 340 kb, the maximum limit on the 66% 
interval is reduced to 0.45 cM or 900 kb, and the maximum confidence limit for the 
95% interval becomes 0.95 cM or 1.9 mb.

<P>One can gain a better perspective on the accuracy of RI-determined linkage 
distance estimates by comparing a map obtained with the BXD set of 26 strains to a 
more accurate map obtained with a set of 374 backcross animals for the same eleven 
loci distributed over a span of 19-31 cM as shown in

There are five instances here in which a single RI discordance has occurred to yield an interlocus 
linkage distance estimate of 1.0 cM:

with a 68% confidence interval extending from 0.7 to 3.4 cM, and a 95% interval extending from 0.2 to 6.6 cM. In three of these cases, 
the backcross estimate lies within the 68% confidence interval and in the other two 
cases, it lies within the 95% interval. There are two instances in which two RI 
discordances have occurred to yield an inter-locus linkage distance estimate of 2.2 cM:

with a 68% confidence interval extending from 1.4 to 5.3 cM and a 95% interval extending from 0.6 to 9.6 cM. 
In both cases, the backcross estimate lies within the 68% interval. There are another two instances in 
which four RI discordances yield an interlocus linkage distance of 5.0 cM:

</UL>
with a 68% confidence interval extending from 3.3 to 
9.7 cM, and a 95% interval extending from 1.7 to 17 cM. In one case, the backcross 
estimate lies within the 68% interval, and in the other case, it lies within the 95% 
confidence interval. Finally, there is a single instance of complete RI concordance between 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:90738" TARGET="_top">D17Mit10</A> and 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:90850" TARGET="_top">D17Mit6</A>. 
The backcross estimate of linkage distance between these two loci lies outside the 95% confidence interval 
(but within the 99% confidence interval according to results obtained from the computer program listed in 
<A HREF="d.shtml">Appendix D</A>).

<P>In summary, backcross estimates lie within the 68% confidence interval of the 
RI estimates in six (60%) of the ten pairwise comparisons, and in all but one of the 
remaining comparisons (90%), the backcross estimates lie within the 95% confidence 
interval. This level of accuracy is about as close as one can get to that predicted from 
statistical formulations. Furthermore, in the single case where the two mean 
estimates of linkage distance are significantly different from each other (0.66 cM versus 5.9 cM for 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:90738" TARGET="_top">D17Mit10</A> - 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:90850" TARGET="_top">D17Mit6</A>), 
their associated 95% confidence intervals 
(0.02-3.95 cM and 3.9-8.8 cM) do overlap (barely), and the data taken together would 
suggest that the actual recombination frequency is somewhere between the two 
extreme mean values.

<a name="9.2.5"></a><H3>9.2.5 Using RI strains to dissect complex genetic traits</H3>

<a name="9.2.5.1"></a><H3><I>9.2.5.1 Susceptibility, predisposition, penetrance, and expressivity</I></H3>

<P>When Bailey first conceived of RI strains, it was with the notion that they would 
be useful for the analysis of the many forms of complex phenotypic variation that 
distinguish different inbred strains from each other. In the past, the use of RI strains 
for this purpose had been rather limited because of the absence of an overall 
framework of genetic markers on which phenotypic differences could be mapped. 
However, at present, the availability of highly polymorphic, rapidly typed DNA 
markers is allowing the construction of framework maps of marker loci that span 
essentially whole genomes in each of the major RI sets. These framework maps will 
finally open up RI strains to the use originally conceived of by Bailey.

<P>There is an enormous reservoir of susceptibility differences to a variety of disease 
conditions, both chronic and infectious, among the classical inbred strains. For 
example, the A/J strain is relatively susceptible to various carcinogen-induced 
cancers (lung adenomas, sarcomas, and colorectal tumors), parasites 
(<I>Giardia</I>, <I>Trypanosoma</I>, and <I>Plasmodium</I>), bacteria 
(<I>Listeria</I> and <I>Pseudomonas</I>), viruses (<I>Ectromelia</I> and <I>Herpes</I>), 
and fungi (<I>Candida albicans</I>), as well as gall stones and 
teratogen-induced cleft palate; the B6 strain is relatively resistant to all of these conditions 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Mu1" TARGET="_top">Mu et al., 1993</a>). On the other hand, B6 is relatively susceptible to other 
parasites, bacteria, viruses, and fungi as well as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and obesity; 
the A/J strain is relatively resistant to all of these conditions. In all, strain-specific 
differences in susceptibility to over 30 infectious or chronic diseases have been 
identified between A/J and B6, and the genetic basis for each can be approached with 
the use of the combined AXB/BXA set of RI strains. Differences in disease 
susceptibility exist among all of the traditional inbred strains, and the genes 
involved in many of these differences can be approached as well with the 
appropriate RI sets.

<P>With most of the conditions described above, a particular genetic constitution 
only <I>predisposes</I> an individual to express a disease. This means that some 
individuals that carry the predisposing genotype will actually <I>not</I> express the 
disease. The fraction of genotypically identical individuals that express a particular trait defines the 
<A HREF="../glossary.shtml#Penetrance" TARGET="_top">penetrance</A> of that trait from that genotype. When a particular 
genotype guarantees the expression of a phenotype in 100% of the animals that carry 
it, the phenotype is considered to be <I>completely penetrant</I>. In all other cases, a 
phenotype is considered to be <I>partially penetrant</I> or <I>incompletely penetrant</I>. For 
example, a particular substrain of BALB/c mice is predisposed to a particular form of 
induced cancer known as a plasmacytoma. However, only 60% of these inbred 
animals actually get the cancer upon induction. Thus, the penetrance of induced-
plasmacytoma in these mice is 60%. 

<P>The cousin of incomplete penetrance is <I>variable 
<A HREF="../glossary.shtml#Expressivity" TARGET="_top">expressivity</A></I>. Variable 
expressivity describes the situation in which multiple individuals all express a 
particular trait, but in a quantitatively distinguishable manner. For example, a 
tumor may appear at a young age or an old age, a birth defect such as cleft palate may 
be more or less severe. Variable expressivity can also be measured for traits that do 
not show an either/or type of wild-type/mutant variation. For example, there are 
many strain-specific differences in physiological parameters and behavior that are 
strictly quantitative. Thus, blood cholesterol levels may vary among different 
strains as will the average number of pups that a female has in a litter (see 
<a href="javascript:windowt41 = window.open('../tables/table4-1.shtml', 'windowt41', 'width=600,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt41.focus()">Table 4.1</a>).

<P>Both incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity can be caused by genetic as 
well as non-genetic factors. Inbred strains allow one to clearly distinguish genetic 
factors since measurements can be made of the mean level of expression or 
penetrance of a trait in one strain relative to another when populations of both are 
maintained under identical environmental conditions.

<P>In cases where two strains differ quantitatively in penetrance levels and/or 
expressivity for a particular trait, it becomes difficult to design traditional breeding 
crosses that can uncover the loci involved. For example, if strain A shows 20% 
penetrance for a trait and strain B shows 80% penetrance for the same trait, then its 
expression in offspring from a cross between the two strains would not provide 
straightforward information as to which predisposing allele(s) is present. In 
contrast, each RI strain provides an unlimited number of animals with the same 
homozygous genotype. Thus, through the analysis of a sufficient number of 
animals, it becomes possible to quantitate the levels of penetrance and expressivity 
and associate distinct measurements of mean and standard deviation with each RI 
genotype. Furthermore, it is just as easy to map recessive traits as dominant traits 
since RI strains are completely homozygous.

<P>RI strains are also useful in those cases where multiple animals must be 
sacrificed in order to make a single phenotypic determination. This will be true for 
certain biochemical assays (although in most cases today, microtechniques allow 
analysis on tissues obtained from single animals) and for other assays that require a 
determination of multiple test points in which each point is a single animal. An 
example of the latter would be an LD<SUB>50</SUB> determination for a particular toxic 
chemical.
<SUP><A HREF="notes.shtml#86" TARGET="_top">86</A></SUP>

<P>If every RI strain in a set expresses a trait with essentially the same penetrance 
and expressivity as one of the two progenitor strains, and approximately half of the 
RI strains resemble one progenitor and half resemble the other, determining a map 
position for the responsible locus is no different than that described earlier in the 
case of DNA marker loci. Data of this type can be viewed as evidence in favor of a 
single major locus that is responsible for the difference in susceptibility, penetrance, 
or expressivity between the two progenitor strains. One can simply write out an SDP 
for the phenotype and then subject this SDP to concordance analysis with the SDPs 
obtained for all previously typed markers as described in 
<a href="9-2.shtml#9.2.2">Section 9.2.2.</a> Once linkage 
is demonstrated, gene order and map distances can be determined as described in 
Sections 
<A HREF="9-2.shtml#9.2.3">9.2.3</A> and 
<A HREF="9-2.shtml#9.2.4">9.2.4</A>.

<a name="9.2.5.2"></a><H3>9.2.5.2 Further genetic complexity: polygenic traits</H3>

<P>There are two forms of RI strain data that are indicative of a more complex basis 
of inheritance which may be impossible to resolve using only the RI approach. The 
first occurs when there is a significant departure from a balanced SDP in that the 
phenotype expressed by one progenitor strain is found in many more RI strains than 
the alternative phenotype. Data of this type would suggest that the expression of the 
rarer phenotype requires the simultaneous presence of two or more genes from the 
appropriate progenitor. One can calculate the probability of occurrence of a 
phenotype that requires the action of two or more unlinked loci through the law of 
the product as (0.5)<SUP><I>n</I></SUP>, where <I>n</I> is the number of loci required.
<SUP><A HREF="notes.shtml#87" TARGET="_top">87</A></SUP> 
Thus, if two unlinked B6 loci are both required for susceptibility to a particular viral infection 
(relative to DBA), only (0.5)<SUP>2</SUP> &#061; 25% of the BXD RI strains would be expected to show 
susceptibility. Unfortunately, for obvious reasons, unbalanced SDPs cannot be 
compared directly for linkage relationships with normal single-locus marker SDPs.
<SUP><A HREF="notes.shtml#88" TARGET="_top">88</A></SUP>

<P>The second form of RI data indicative of genetic complexity is the occurrence of 
strains that show a level of penetrance or expressivity that is significantly different 
from both of the progenitors. Since every RI strain can be considered homozygous 
for one progenitor allele or the other at every locus, data of this type will also 
implicate the action of multiple genes. The simplest explanation for these results is 
that different combinations of alleles from the two progenitors cause the different 
levels of phenotypic expression. For example, with the involvement of two loci, X 
and Y, in the expression of a trait that distinguishes the strains A/J and B6, there 
will be four relevant genotypes among the AXB/BXA RI strains:

<UL> 
<LI><I>X<SUP>A</SUP>Y<SUP>A</SUP></I> 
<LI><I>X<SUP>A</SUP>Y<SUP>B</SUP></I> 
<LI><I>X<SUP>B</SUP>Y<SUP>A</SUP></I>
<LI><I>X<SUP>B</SUP>Y<SUP>B</SUP></I>
</UL> 

Two of these genotypic combinations are different than that found 
in either progenitor and one or both could be responsible for a novel phenotypic 
expression.
<SUP><A HREF="notes.shtml#89" TARGET="_top">89</A></SUP>

<P>Many variations upon these examples are possible. Thus, every complex trait 
will have to be approached independently to formulate a reasonable hypothesis for 
inheritance. In some cases, RI strains may still provide an appropriate tool for 
genetic analysis, but in most cases, it will be necessary to move to a different form of 
analysis that may require the establishment of a new breeding cross as described in

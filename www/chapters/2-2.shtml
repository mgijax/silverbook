<a name="2.2.1"></a><H3>2.2.1 Mice, people, and dinosaurs</H3>

<P>The common ancestor to mice and humans was an inconspicuous rodent-like 
mammal that scurried along the surface of the earth some 65 million years (myr) 
before present (BP). It had to be inconspicuous because the earth was ruled by 
enormous dinosaurs, many of whom would have eaten any small mammal that 
could be caught. The glorious age of the dinosaurs came to an abrupt end with the 
collision of one or a few large extraterrestrial objects &#151; perhaps asteroids or comets &#151; 
into the earth's surface over a relatively short period of time 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Alvarez1" TARGET="_top">Alvarez and Asaro, 1990</a>; 
<a href="../references.shtml#Sheehan1" TARGET="_top">Sheehan et al., 1991</a>). Possible sites at which these impacts may have occurred 
have been identified in the Yucatan peninsula of Mexico and the state of Iowa 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Kerr1" TARGET="_top">Kerr, 1991</a>; 
<a href="../references.shtml#Kerr2" TARGET="_top">Kerr, 1992</a>; 
<a href="../references.shtml#Kerr3" TARGET="_top">Kerr, 1993</a>). It has been hypothesized that the impact resulted 
in the formation of a thick cloud of dust that dispersed and shrouded the earth for a 
period of years, leading to a scenario like a nuclear winter with the demise of all 
green life, and with that, all large animals that depended either directly on plants for 
survival or indirectly on the animals that ate the plants. At least a small number of 
our rodent-like ancestors were presumably able to survive this long sunless winter 
as a consequence of their small size which allowed them to &#034;get by&#034; eating seeds 
alone. When the sun finally returned, the seeds lying dormant on the ground 
sprung to life and the world became an extremely fertile place. In the absence of 
competition from the dinosaurs, mammals were able to become the dominant large 
animal group, and they radiated out into numerous species that could take 
advantage of all the newly unoccupied ecological niches. It was in this context that 
the demise of the dinosaurs brought forth both humans and mice as well as most 
other mammalian species on earth today.

<a name="2.2.2"></a><H3>2.2.2 From Asia to Europe and from Europe to the New World</H3>
<P>The Muridae family of rodents, which includes both &#034;true&#034; mice and rats, 
originated in the area across present-day India and Southeast Asia. Phylogenetic and 
palaeontological data suggest that mice and rats diverged apart from a common 
ancestor 10-15 myr BP 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Jaeger1" TARGET="_top">Jaeger et al., 1986</a>), and by 6 myr BP, the genus <i>Mus</i> was 
established. The <i>Mus</i> genus has since diverged into a variety of species (listed in 
<a href="javascript:windowf22 = window.open('../figures/figure2-2.shtml', 'windowf22', 'width=720,height=700,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf22.focus()">Figure 2.2</a>) 
across the Indian subcontinent and neighboring lands. 

<P>At the beginning of the Neolithic transition some 10,000 years ago, the 
progenitors to the house mouse (collectively known as <i>Mus musculus</i>, as discussed 
<a href="2-3.shtml">later in this chapter</a>) had already undergone divergence into four separate 
populations that must have occupied non-overlapping ranges in and around the 
Indian subcontinent. Present speculation is that the <i>domesticus</i> group was focused 
along the steppes of present-day Pakistan to the west of India 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Auffray1" TARGET="_top">Auffray et al., 1990</a>); 
the <i>musculus</i> group may have been in Northern India 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Horiuchi1" TARGET="_top">Horiuchi et al., 1992</a>; 
<a href="../references.shtml#Boursot1" TARGET="_top">Boursot et al., 1993</a>); the <i>castaneus</i> group was in the area of Bangladesh, and the 
founder population &#151; <i>bactrianus</i> &#151; remained in India proper.

<P>The house mouse could only begin its 
<A HREF="../glossary.shtml#Commensal" TARGET="_top">commensal</A> association with humans after 
agricultural communities had formed. Once this leap in civilization had occurred, 
mice from the <i>domesticus</i> group in Pakistan spread into the villages and farms of 
the fertile crescent as illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf12 = window.open('../figures/figure1-2.shtml', 'windowf12', 'width=680,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf12.focus()">Figure 1.2</a> 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Auffray1" TARGET="_top">Auffray et al., 1990</a>); mice from the 
<i>musculus</i> group may have spread to a second center of civilization in China 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Horiuchi1" TARGET="_top">Horiuchi et al., 1992</a>); and finally, 
<i>bactrianus</i> and <i>castaneus</i> animals went from the 
fields to nearby communities established in India and Southeast Asia respectively.
 
<P>Much later (&#126;4000 yrs BP), the <i>domesticus</i> and <i>musculus</i> forms of the house 
mouse made their way to Europe. The <i>domesticus</i> animals moved with migrating 
agriculturalists from the Middle East across Southwestern Europe 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Sokal1" TARGET="_top">Sokal et al., 1991</a>) 
and the development of sea transport hastened the sweep of both mice and people 
through the Mediterranean basin and North Africa. Invasion of Europe by 
<i>musculus</i> animals occurred by a separate route from the East. Chinese voyagers 
brought these mice along in their carts and wagons, and they migrated along with 
their hosts across Russia and further west to present-day Germany where their 
spread was stopped by the boundary of the <i>domesticus</i> range 
(<a href="javascript:windowf23 = window.open('../figures/figure2-3.shtml', 'windowf23', 'width=670,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf23.focus()">Figure 2.3</a>). Finally, it 
is only within the last millennium that mice have spread to all inhabited parts of 
the world including sub-Saharan Africa, the Americas, Australia, and the many 
islands in-between.

<a name="2.2.3"></a><H3>2.2.3 Tracing the movement of humankind with mice as markers</H3>

<P>One interesting sidelight of the stowaway tendency of mice is that it is sometimes 
possible to observe the origin of human populations within the context of the mice 
that have come along with them. A clear example of this concordance is seen in the 
<i>domesticus</i> mice that have colonized all of North America, South America, 
Australia, and sub-Saharan Africa in conjunction with their Western European 
human partners 
(<a href="javascript:windowf23 = window.open('../figures/figure2-3.shtml', 'windowf23', 'width=670,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf23.focus()">Figure 2.3</a>). 
A more complex example is observed in the Japanese 
islands where the native mice were long thought to be a separate subspecies or 
species group referred to in the literature as <i>Mus molossinus</i>. In fact, molecular 
phylogenetic studies have demonstrated that Japanese mice do not represent a 
distinct evolutionary line at all.

<P>Instead, they appear to have been derived by hybridization of two other house mouse groups on the mainland nearby 
&#151; <i>musculus</i> in China and <i>castaneus</i> in Southeast Asia 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Yonekawa3" TARGET="_top">Yonekawa et al., 1988</a>, 
<a href="javascript:windowf23 = window.open('../figures/figure2-3.shtml', 'windowf23', 'width=670,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf23.focus()">Figure 2.3</a>). The hybrid character of the mice parallels the hybrid origin of the Japanese 
people themselves.

<P>Finally, there is the interesting observation of a pocket of mice from the 
<i>castaneus</i> group that has recently been uncovered in Southern California 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Gardner1" TARGET="_top">Gardner et al., 1991</a>). 
This is the only documented example of an established natural house 
mouse population in the Americas that is <I>not</I> derived from the Western European <i>domesticus</i> group. 
This finding is a testament to the strong wave of 20th century Asian migration to the West Coast of the United States.

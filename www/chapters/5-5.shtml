<a name="5.5.1"></a><H3>5.5.1 Overview</H3>
From the birth of the field of genetics until a decade ago, it was generally 
assumed that the parental origin of a gene could have no effect on its function. In 
the vast majority of studies carried out during the last 90 years, this paradigm has 
appeared to hold true. However, with increasingly sophisticated genetic and 
embryological investigations in the mouse, important exceptions to this rule have 
been uncovered over the last decade. First, the results of nuclear transplantation 
experiments carried out with single-cell fertilized embryos have demonstrated an 
absolute requirement for both a maternally-derived and a paternally-derived 
pronculeus to allow full-term development 
(<a href="../references.shtml#McGrath1" TARGET="_top">McGrath and Solter, 1983</a>). Second, in 
animals that receive both homologs of certain chromosomes or subchromosomal 
regions from one parent and not the other (through the mating of translocation 
heterozygotes as described in 
<a href="5-2.shtml#5.2.3">Section 5.2.3</a>), dramatic effects on development can be 
observed including enhanced or retarded growth and outright lethality 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Cattanach1" TARGET="_top">Cattanach and Kirk, 1985</a>). Third, either of 
two deletions that cover a small region of mouse 
chromosome 17 can be transmitted normally from a father to his offspring, but these 
same deletions cause prenatal lethality when they are maternally transmitted 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Johnson1" TARGET="_top">Johnson, 1974</A>; 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Winking1" TARGET="_top">Winking and Silver, 1984</A>). 
Fourth, similar parent-of-origin effects 
have been observed on the phenotypes expressed by animals that carry a targeted 
knock-out allele at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96434" TARGET="_top"><I>Igf2</I></A> locus 
(<a href="../references.shtml#DeChiara1" TARGET="_top">DeChiara et al., 1991</a>). Finally, molecular 
techniques have been used to directly demonstrate the expression of transcripts 
from one parental allele and not the other at the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96435" TARGET="_top"><I>Igf2r</I></A> locus 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Barlow3" TARGET="_top">Barlow et al., 1991</a>) and the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95891" TARGET="_top"><I>H19</I></A> locus 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Bartolomei1" TARGET="_top">Bartolomei et al., 1991</a>).

<P>The accumulated data indicate that a subset of mouse genes (on the order of 0.2%) will function 
differently in normal embryos depending on whether they have been inherited 
through the male or the female gamete, such that one allele will be expressed and 
the other will be silent. <I>Genomic imprinting</I> is the term that has been coined to 
describe this situation in which the phenotype expressed by a gene varies depending 
on its parental origin 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Sapienza1" TARGET="_top">Sapienza, 1989</a>). 
Further experiments have demonstrated 
that, in general, the &#034;imprint&#034; is erased and regenerated during gametogenesis so 
that the function of an imprintable gene is fully determined by the sex of its 
progenitor alone, and not by earlier ancestors.

<P>With the demonstration of genomic imprinting in the mouse, patterns of 
disease inheritance in humans have been investigated for the possibility of 
phenotypes determined by parent of origin in this mammal as well. To date, clear-cut 
parental effects have been uncovered in the transmission of the juvenile form of 
Huntington disease 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Ridley1" TARGET="_top">Ridley et al., 1991</a>), 
Prader-Willi and Angelman deletion syndromes 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Nichols1" TARGET="_top">Nicholls et al., 1989</a>) 
and certain forms of juvenile familial carcinomas 
such as multifocal retinoblastoma, Wilm's tumor, embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma 
and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Ferguson1" TARGET="_top">Ferguson-Smith et al., 1990</A>; 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Henry1" TARGET="_top">Henry et al., 1991</A>; 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Sapienza2" TARGET="_top">Sapienza, 1991</A>).

<a name="5.5.2"></a><H3>5.5.2 Why is there imprinting?</H3>

<P>The first explanation for the existence of imprinting was as a mechanism to 
prevent the full-term development of parthenogenetic embryos. This explanation 
was never satisfactory because it did not account for the intricate control of 
imprinting at multiple well-bounded loci. An alternative hypothesis put forward by 
Haig and his colleagues is based on a tug of war between the sexes 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Haig1" TARGET="_top">Haig and Graham, 1991</A>; 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Moore2" TARGET="_top">Moore and Haig, 1991</A>). 
According to this hypothesis, it is in the 
interest of a male to attempt to recover more maternal resources for his developing 
offspring in relation to offspring in the same mother that were sired by other males. 
This can be accomplished with a paternal imprint that down-regulates the 
expression of genes that normally act to slow down the growth of embryos. As a 
consequence, embryos that are sired by these males will grow more rapidly than 
half-siblings sired by other males. Although overgrowth may be beneficial to these 
offspring, it extracts a heavy reproductive cost from the mother. Consequently, it is 
in the interest of the mother to counteract this increased level of growth. She can 
do this with an imprint that down-regulates the relevant growth factor genes 
themselves. The evolutionary endpoint of this tug of war is the current day 
situation where genes that act to increase embryonic growth (such as 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96434" TARGET="_top"><I>Igf2</I></A>) have 
inactivated maternal alleles, and genes that act to limit growth (such as 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96435" TARGET="_top"><I>Igf2r</I></A>) have 
inactivated paternal alleles.

<P>The only other currently viable hypothesis to explain imprinting is that it results 
from the accidental, ectopic use of machinery that has evolved for the really 
important imprinting associated with X chromosome inactivation. According to 
this hypothesis, autosomal imprinting is a red herring whose study is unlikely to 
provide information of significance to an understanding of developmental genetics. 
The major strike against this hypothesis is dealt by selectionists who would contend 
that genetic accidents of this magnitude just do not happen and there must be 
something peculiar about mammals that has promoted the evolution of 
imprinting. In support of the selectionist view is the recent demonstration of 
mono-allelic expression of the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/omim.html'-->103280" TARGET="_top"><I>H19</I></A> gene in humans 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Zhang2" TARGET="_top">Zhang and Tycko, 1992</a>). 
Conservation of imprinting during the evolution of both humans and mice from a 
common ancestor strongly suggests the existence of selective forces. Nevertheless, it 
is still possible that the Haig hypothesis is not entirely correct and that other reasons 
for imprinting lie hidden beneath the surface waiting to be uncovered.

<a name="5.5.3"></a><H3>5.5.3 The molecular basis for imprinting</H3>

<P>The question &#034;how does it happen?&#034; can be easily separated from the question 
&#034;why does it happen?&#034;. However, here again, our understanding is still quite 
rudimentary. 
<a href="javascript:windowf58 = window.open('../figures/figure5.8.shtml', 'windowf58', 'width=400,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf58.focus()">Figure 5.8</A> 
illustrates in a very general way the essential requirements 
of a paternal imprinting system. Both parents have one imprinted allele (derived 
from their fathers) and one active allele (derived from their mothers). During 
oogenesis, the imprint must be erased so that all eggs will contain equivalent alleles 
that can become activated in all offspring. In contrast, at the completion of 
spermatogenesis in the father, all sperm will contain alleles that are &#034;marked&#034; for 
imprinting. It is possible that the mark present on one of the father's alleles is 
erased and both copies are marked <I>de novo</I> in all spermatogenic cells, or the one 
imprinted copy may retain its mark, with <I>de novo</I> marking applied only at the 
second copy. In either case, the new embryo will receive one &#034;marked&#034; gene from 
the father and one non-marked gene from the mother.

<P>The &#034;mark&#034; may itself be replicated faithfully along with its homolog, and the 
&#034;mark&#034; may itself be responsible for the actual repression of gene activity. On the 
other hand, the &#034;mark&#034; may simply identify the paternal allele so that a separate 
imprinting machinery that acts to prevent gene repression can be laid down within 
the developing embryo. If there is a separate imprinting machinery, either it or the 
&#034;mark&#034; could be replicated along with the paternal homolog to maintain the 
imprint through each cell division.

<P>It is still the case in 1993 that the nature of both the mark and the imprinting 
machinery (if it exists as a separate entity) are entirely unknown. Both could 
presumably entail direct chemical modifications of DNA and/or specific protein 
components (that might lead to changes in the local chromatin configuration). In 
addition, the specific DNA sequences that must be recognized by the gametogenic 
marker are also unknown at this time.

<a name="1.3"></a><H2>1.3 THE NEW BIOLOGY AND THE MOUSE MODEL</H2>

<a name="1.3.1"></a><H3>1.3.1 All mammals have closely related genomes</H3>

<P>The movement of mouse genetics from a backwater field of study to the 
forefront of modern biomedical research was catalyzed by the recombinant DNA 
revolution, which began 20 years ago and has been accelerating in pace ever since. 
With the ability to isolate cloned copies of genes and to compare DNA sequences 
from different organisms came the realization that mice and humans (as well as all 
other placental mammals) are even more similar genetically than they were 
thought to be previously. An astounding finding has been that all human genes 
have counterparts in the mouse genome which can almost always be recognized by 
cross-species hybridization. Thus, the cloning of a human gene leads directly to the 
cloning of a mouse homolog which can be used for genetic, molecular, and 
biochemical studies that can then be extrapolated back to an understanding of the 
function of the human gene. In only a subset of cases are mammalian genes 
conserved within the genomes of <i>Drosophila</i> or <i>C. elegans</i>. 

<P>This result should not be surprising in light of current estimates for the time of 
divergence of mice, flies and nematodes from the evolutionary line leading to 
humans. In general, three types of information have been used to build 
phylogenetic trees for distantly related members of the animal kingdom &#151; 
paleontological data based on radiodated fossil remains, sequence comparisons of 
highly conserved proteins, and direct comparisons of the most highly conserved 
genomic sequences, namely the ribosomal genes. Unfortunately, flies (<i>Drosophila</i>) 
and nematodes (<i>C. elegans</i>) diverged apart from the line leading to mammals just prior 
to the time of the earliest fossil records in the Cambrian period which occurred 570 
million years ago. The divergence of 
mice and people occurred relatively recently at 60 million years before present (see 
<a href="2-2.shtml#2.2.1">Section 2.2.1</a>). These numbers are presented graphically in 
<a href="javascript:windowf13 = window.open('../figures/figure1-3.shtml', 'windowf13', 'width=680,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf13.focus()">Figure 1.3</a>, 
where a quick glance serves to drive home the fact that humans and mice are ten times more 
closely related to each other than either is to flies or nematodes.

<P>Although the haploid chromosome number associated with different 
mammalian species varies tremendously, the haploid content of mammalian DNA 
remains constant at approximately three billion basepairs. It is not only the size of 
the genome that has remained constant among mammals; the underlying genomic 
organization (discussed in 
<a href="5-1.shtml">Chapter 5</a>) has also remained the same as well. Large 
genomic segments &#151; on average, 10-20 million basepairs &#151; have been 
conserved virtually intact between mice, humans, and other mammals as well. In fact, the 
available data suggest that a rough replica of the human genome could be built by 
simply breaking the mouse genome into 130-170 pieces and pasting them back 
together again in a new order 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Nadeau1" TARGET="_top">Nadeau, 1984</a>; 
<a href="../references.shtml#Copeland2" TARGET="_top">Copeland et al., 1993</a>). Although all 
mammals are remarkably similar in their overall body plan, there are some 
differences in the details of both development and metabolism, and occasionally 
these differences can prevent the extrapolation of mouse data to humans and vice 
versa 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Erickson1" TARGET="_top">Erickson, 1989</a>). Nevertheless, the mouse has proven itself over and over 
again as being the model experimental animal <i>par excellence</i> for studies of nearly all 
aspects of human genetics.

<a name="1.3.2"></a><H3>1.3.2 The mouse is an ideal model organism</H3>

<P>Among mammals, the mouse is ideally suited for genetic analysis. First, it is 
among the smallest mammals known with adult weights in the range of 25-40 
g, 2,000-3,000-fold lighter than the average human adult. Second, it has a short 
generation time &#151; on the order of 10 weeks from being born to giving birth. Third, 
females breed prolifically in the lab with an average of 5-10 pups per litter and an 
immediate postpartum estrus. Fourth, an often forgotten advantage is the fact that 
fathers do not harm their young, and thus breeding pairs can be maintained 
together after litters are born. Fifth, for developmental studies, the deposition of a 
vaginal plug allows an investigator to time all pregnancies without actually 
witnessing the act of copulation and, once again, without removing males from the 
breeding cage. Finally, most laboratory-bred strains are relatively docile and easy to 
handle. 

<P>The high resolution genetic studies to be discussed later in this book require the 
analysis of large numbers of offspring from each of the crosses under analysis. Thus, 
a critical quotient in choosing an organism can be expressed as the number of 
animals bred per square meter of animal facility space per year. For mice, this 
number can be as high as 3,000 pups/m<sup>2</sup> including the actual space for racks (five 
shelves high) as well as the inter-rack space as well. All of the reasons listed here 
make the mouse an excellent species for genetic analysis and have helped to make it 
the major model for the study of human disease and normative biology.

<a name="1.3.3"></a><H3>1.3.3 Manipulation of the mouse genome and micro-analysis</H3>

<P>The close correspondence discovered between the genomes of mice and humans 
would not, in and of itself, have been sufficient to drive workers into mouse 
genetics without the simultaneous development, during the last decade, of 
increasingly more sophisticated tools to study and manipulate the embryonic 
genome. Today, genetic material from any source (natural, synthetic or a 
combination of the two) can be injected directly into the nuclei of fertilized eggs; two 
or more cleavage-stage embryos can be teased apart into component cells and put 
back together again in new &#034;chimeric&#034; combinations; nuclei can be switched back 
and forth among different embryonic cytoplasma; embryonic cells can be placed into 
tissue culture, where targeted manipulation of individual genes can be 
accomplished before these cells are returned to the embryo proper. Genetically 
altered live animals can be obtained subsequent to all of these procedures, and these 
animals can transmit their altered genetic material to their offspring. The protocols 
involved in all of these manipulations of embryos and genomes have become well-established and <i>cookbook</i> manuals 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Joyner1" TARGET="_top">Joyner, 1993</a>; 
<a href="../references.shtml#Wassarman3" TARGET="_top">Wassarman and DePamphilis, 1993</a>; 
<a href="../references.shtml#Hogan1" TARGET="_top">Hogan et al., 1994</a>) as well as a video guide to the protocols involved 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Pedersen1" TARGET="_top">Pedersen et al., 1993</a>) have been published.

<P>While it is likely that none of these manipulations has yet been applied to 
human embryos and genomes, it is ethical, rather than technical, roadblocks that 
impede progress in this direction. The mental image invoked is of a far more 
sophisticated technology than the so-called futuristic scenario of embryo farms 
described in Huxley's <i>Brave New World</i>  
(<a href="../references.shtml#Huxley1" TARGET="_top">1932</a>).

<P>Progress has also been made at the level of molecular analysis within the 
developing embryo. With the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol, DNA and 
RNA sequences from single cells can be characterized, and enhanced versions of the 
somewhat older techniques of <i>in situ</i> hybridization and immuno-staining allow 
investigators to follow the patterns of individual gene expression through the four 
dimensions of space and time 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Wassarman3" TARGET="_top">Wassarman and DePamphilis, 1993</a>; 
<a href="../references.shtml#Hogan1" TARGET="_top">Hogan et al., 
1994</a>). In addition, with the omnipresent micro-techniques developed across the 
field of biochemistry, the traditional requirement for large research animals like the 
rat, rabbit, or guinea pig has all but evaporated.

<a name="1.3.4"></a><H3>1.3.4 High resolution genetics</H3>

<P>Finally, with the automation and simplification of molecular assays that has 
occurred over the last several years, it has become possible to determine 
chromosomal map positions to a very high degree of resolution. Genetic studies of 
this type are relying increasingly on extremely polymorphic microsatellite loci 
(<a href="8-3.shtml">Section 8.3</a>) to produce anchored linkage maps 
(<a href="9-1.shtml">Chapter 9</a>), and large insert cloning 
vectors &#151; such as yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) &#151; to move from the 
observation of a phenotype, to a map of the loci that cause the phenotype, to clones of the loci themselves 
(<a href="10-3.shtml">Section 10.3</a>). 
Thus, many of the advantages that were once uniquely available to investigators 
studying lower organisms, such as flies and worms, can now be applied to the 
mouse through the three-way marriage of genetics, molecular biology, and 
embryology represented in 
<a href="javascript:windowf14 = window.open('../figures/figure1-4.shtml', 'windowf14', 'width=680,height=350,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf14.focus()">Figure 1.4</a> . 
It is the intention of this book to provide the 
conceptual framework and practical basis for the new mouse genetics.

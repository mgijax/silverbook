<a name="4.2"></a><H2>4.2 GERM CELL DIFFERENTIATION AND SEXUAL MATURATION</H2>

<a name="4.2.1"></a><H3>4.2.1 Males</H3>
<P>Male germ cell differentiation occurs continuously in the seminiferous tubules 
of the testes throughout the life of a normal animal. This process has been very 
well characterized in the mouse 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Bellve1" TARGET="_top">Bellv&#233; et al., 1977</a>; 
<a href="../references.shtml#Eddy1" TARGET="_top">Eddy et al., 1991</a>), and only its 
salient features will be summarized here. Spermatogenic cells at different stages are 
classified into four broad categories &#151; <i>spermatogonia</i>, <i>spermatocytes</i>, <i>spermatids</i>, and 
<i>spermatozoa</i> &#151; with numerous substages defined within each category. All 
pre-meiotic cells are called spermatogonia; these include regenerating stem cells as well 
as those that have taken the path to terminal differentiation. With the 
commencement of meiosis, germ cells are called spermatocytes, and subsequent to 
meiosis, haploid cells are called spermatids. Finally, with the release of the 
morphologically mature product, the germ cells are called spermatozoa or, more 
simply, just sperm.

<P>The timing of the stages of spermatogenesis in the mouse was described 
originally by Oakberg 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Oakberg1" TARGET="_top">1956a</a>; 
<a href="../references.shtml#Oakberg2" TARGET="_top">1956b</a>). At birth, the testis contains only 
undifferentiated type A1 spermatogonia, which will serve as a self-renewing stem 
cell population throughout the life of a male mouse. By day three, differentiation 
has begun through a series of mitotic divisions into more advanced spermatogonial 
stages (A<sub>2</sub>, A<sub>3</sub>, A<sub>4</sub>, intermediate and type B spermatogonia). 
By 8 to 10 days, spermatocytes are observed for the first time in the leptotene phase of meiosis 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Nebel1" TARGET="_top">Nebel et al., 1961</a>). 
The meiotic phase is relatively long, extending over a 13 day 
period. When the male has reached 17 to 19 days of age, approximately 50% of the 
seminiferous tubules are found to contain cells in the late pachytene stage. The 
earliest postmeiotic cells &#151; round spermatids &#151; are not observed until after 20 days 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Nebel1" TARGET="_top">Nebel et al., 1961</a>). 
During the next 13 days, the round spermatids differentiate into 
elongating spermatids in which the sperm tail forms and the nucleus condenses. At 
the end of this process, morphologically-mature sperm are released into the fluid-filled lumen.

<P>The entire process of differentiation from stem cell to released spermatozoa is 
called <I>spermatogenesis</I>. The term <I>spermiogenesis</I> refers specifically to the final 
morphological differentiation of haploid cells into sperm. At the time of release 
into the lumen of the seminiferous tubules, sperm cells are still not physiologically 
mature. After leaving the testes, they pass through the <I>epididymis</I> where they 
undergo further biochemical changes. From the epididymis, they go to the <I>vas 
deferens</I>, where they are stored until ejaculation. The final stage of sperm 
maturation &#151; known as <I>capacitation</I> &#151; is required for fertilizing activity and does not 
occur until after contact has been made with the milieu of the female reproductive 
tract.

<a name="4.2.2"></a><H3>4.2.2 Females</H3>

<P>Female germ cell differentiation operates under a two-phase time course 
dramatically different from that found in the male.
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#23" TARGET="_top">23</a></sup> 
By the twelfth or thirteenth 
day after fertilization, the primordial oocytes within the fetal ovary have undergone 
their last mitotic division and are referred to as oogonia. At this point, the young 
female, still not born, has produced all of the germ cells that she will ever have; the 
total number is somewhere between 30,000 and 75,000. All of these oogonia progress 
into meiosis, and by five days after birth, they reach the diplotene stage of prophase 
of the first meiotic division. At this point, also called the dictyate stage, the oogonia 
become arrested and remain quiescent until sexual maturation. As they move into 
the dictyate stage, all primordial oocytes acquire a coat of follicle cells; the complete 
coat surrounding each oocyte is called a follicle.

<P>With the onset of puberty, the ovaries become activated by hormone 
stimulation, and every 4 days, a new group of oogonia are stimulated to proceed 
forward toward their ultimate differentiated state. This second phase of 
differentiation occurs over a period of 20 days. During this entire period &#151; until 
a few hours prior to ovulation &#151; the oocytes still remain fixed in the dictyate stage of 
meiosis, but they become highly active metabolically and increase greatly in size 
from 15 to 80 microns. The size of each follicle also increases through the addition of 
follicle cells up to a total of 50,000 per ovum. At 20 days after activation, oocytes 
have become competent for ovulation, which occurs in response to the correct 
hormonal cues during the estrus cycle described in the 
<A HREF="4-3.shtml">next section</A>. During each 
natural cycle, only 6-16 oocytes are stimulated to undergo ovulation. The 
stimulated follicles swell with fluid and move to the periphery of the ovary where 
they burst out to begin their journey into the oviduct and further down the 
reproductive tract.

<P>Stimulation to ovulate also releases the oocyte (now also called an egg) from its 
state of arrest and induces it to continue through meiosis. The first meiotic division 
is completed and the first polar body is formed prior to release from the ovary. The 
second meiotic division begins immediately but stops at metaphase, where the 
oocyte remains arrested until fertilization. Penetration by the sperm triggers 
completion of the final meiotic division and the formation of the second polar body.

<P>Surprisingly, at least 50% of the oocytes present at birth degenerate before the 
mouse reaches three weeks of age. The vast majority of the remaining oocytes are 
never ovulated &#151; many degenerate throughout the life of the animal, and all that 
remain are eliminated at the time of mouse menopause, which occurs at 
approximately 12-14 months of age.

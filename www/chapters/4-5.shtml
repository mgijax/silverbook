<a name="4.5.1"></a><H3>4.5.1 Artificial insemination</H3>

<P>Although artificial insemination is a critical tool for reproductive biologists 
working with other species (including humans), it is not often used by mouse 
geneticists. Its major use in other species is to initiate a successful pregnancy when, 
for any of a number of reasons, the male cannot or should not, be directly involved 
in the process of mating. Artificial insemination has been a boon to the cattle 
industry because the semen from one good bull can be shipped around the world to 
impregnate unlimited numbers of females. Male mice are somewhat smaller than 
bulls and, as a consequence, the whole animal can be shipped for a cost that is likely 
to be the same (or less) than one would pay for frozen semen alone. Furthermore, 
obtaining semen from a mouse is a &#034;one-shot&#034; deal. Since assisted masturbation of 
the male mouse is not practical, sperm must be recovered from the epididymis after 
the animal has been sacrificed.

<P>There are some special cases where artificial insemination can be used as an 
experimental tool for the study of the mouse. One example is in those cases where, 
for behavioral reasons, males of a particular strain refuse to mate with selected 
females of another strain. This scenario is most likely to occur when the males and 
females are members of different <i>Mus</i> species. 
<a href="../references.shtml#West1" TARGET="_top">West and colleagues (1977</a>) used 
artificial insemination to overcome this problem in order to determine the viability 
of various hybrid embryos formed between distantly related members of the <i>Mus</i> 
genus.

<P>Another use of artificial insemination is in those cases where one wants to alter 
the composition of the sperm pool. For example, 
<a href="../references.shtml#Olds1" TARGET="_top">Olds-Clarke and Peitz (1985</a>) 
were able to analyze the relative fertilizing potentials associated with sperm 
obtained from two different males by mixing equal numbers together before 
insemination. Finally, there will always be the case where a one-of-a-kind male &#151; such 
as a first generation transgenic or another new mutant &#151; refuses to participate 
in the mating process. As a last resort, one can recover epididymal sperm from such 
an animal for a single chance at achieving a pregnancy. Detailed protocols for sperm 
recovery and artificial insemination have been described elsewhere 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Rugh1" TARGET="_top">Rugh, 1968</a>; 
<a href="../references.shtml#West1" TARGET="_top">West et al., 1977</a>; 
<a href="../references.shtml#Olds1" TARGET="_top">Olds-Clarke and Peitz, 1985</a>).

<P>When a choice is possible, females to be inseminated should not be inbred; F<sub>1</sub> 
hybrids and random-bred animals will always have higher levels of fertility. A 
successful fertilization can only occur when the inseminated female is in the late 
proestrus/early estrus stage of the estrus cycle. Appropriately staged females can be 
obtained either by visual inspection of naturally cycling animals (as described 
<A HREF="4-3.shtml#4.3.2">earlier in this chapter</A>) 
or through superovulation (see 
<a href="6-2.shtml">Section 6.2</a>). The implantation of 
fertilized embryos will occur only in females that have been stimulated into a state 
of pseudopregnancy 
(<a href="6-2.shtml#6.2.3">Section 6.2.3</a>). If the investigator intends to use a sterile stud 
male for this purpose, the mating should be performed after the insemination 
(within 0.5-2 hours) so that the vaginal plug does not interfere with the protocol 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Olds1" TARGET="_top">Olds-Clarke and Peitz, 1985</a>). 
If pseudopregnancy is to be induced manually, it 
should be accomplished in the fully alert female prior to the insemination protocol (see 
<a href="6-2.shtml#6.2.3">Section 6.2.3</a> for details).

<a name="4.5.2"></a><H3>4.5.2 Transplantation of ovaries</H3>

<P>In a small number of instances, females that express certain mutations may be 
fertile in the sense that they are able to produce functional oocytes but infertile in 
the sense that they are physically unable to bring offspring to term. Such females 
may not be able to mate, they may not be fit enough to allow gestation to proceed 
properly or they may be unable to birth live offspring. 

<P>In such cases, it is possible to 
transplant the ovaries from these incapacitated females into healthy females of 
another strain as means for obtaining germ line transmission 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Russell7" TARGET="_top">Russell and Hurst, 1945</a>; 
<a href="../references.shtml#Stevens1" TARGET="_top">Stevens, 1957</a>). This protocol is commonly used at the 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Jackson Laboratory</A> to 
maintain several mutant strains of mice, including those that carry the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:104663" TARGET="_top">obese</A> 
mutation, the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97588" TARGET="_top">dwarf</A> mutation, or the 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:99912" TARGET="_top">dystrophia muscularis</A> 
(muscular dystrophy) mutation. 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Green6" TARGET="_top">Green and Witham, 1991</a>).

<a name="4.5.3"></a><H3>4.5.3 In vitro fertilization</H3>

A third method of assisted reproduction entails fertilization outside the female 
reproductive tract. There are two general types of circumstances when in vitro 
fertilization becomes useful: when the <i>female</i> partner of a cross is unable to carry 
litters to term for one reason or another; and when an investigator wants to 
establish the timing of fertilization to a more precise degree and/or wants to 
synchronize the development of a batch of embryos for later recovery and analysis. 
A detailed discussion of this procedure and all other aspects of embryo 
manipulation are provided in the manual by 
<a href="../references.shtml#Hogan1" TARGET="_top">Hogan and her colleagues (1994</a>).

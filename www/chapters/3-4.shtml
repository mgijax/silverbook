<a name="3.4"></a><H2>3.4 STANDARDIZED NOMENCLATURE</H2>

<a name="3.4.1"></a><H3>3.4.1 Introduction</H3>

<P>Mouse genetics is, by its very nature, a collaborative field of scientific
investigation. This is because the interpretation of data collected by any one scientist
is highly dependent on data collected by others. High resolution genetic maps are
often formed through the integration of results obtained in many individual
studies, and as each new result is published, it can be swept up into a system of
databases (see
<a href="b.shtml">Appendix B</a>). Large-scale integration has been possible only because all mouse
geneticists speak the same language. The definition of this language is provided by the
International Committee on Standardized Nomenclature for Mice which has
been in existence since 1939. This committee is charged with the task of establishing
and updating rules and guidelines for genetic nomenclature. The continued
functioning of this committee is critical because, as the analysis of the genome
becomes ever more sophisticated, new genetic entities become apparent, and these
must be named in a standard fashion.

<P>For a complete description of the &#034;Rules and Guidelines for Gene
Nomenclature,&#034; one should consult the Lyon and Searle book
(<a href="../references.shtml#Committee1" TARGET="_top">Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice, 1989</a>),
and updates published regularly in <i>Mouse Genome</i>. Here, I will briefly review the salient features of this
nomenclature system with a focus on the naming of newly defined genes and loci.
Once an investigator has chosen a new name and symbol for a locus, the chair of the
Committee should be contacted for confirmation that the rules have been followed
properly, and the names do not conflict with others already in use.

<a name="3.4.2"></a><H3>3.4.2 Strain symbols</H3>

<P>There is no rhyme or reason to the names given to the original inbred strains
derived at the beginning of the century. The name of the famous BALB/c line was
derived by co-joining the name of the investigator (Bagg) with the color of the mouse
(<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:98880" TARGET="_top">albino</A>).


<P>Bagg's ALBino became BALB. Other famous strains have names
based on animal numbers; for example, female no. 57 (from Abbie Lathrop's farm)
gave rise to both the C57BL/6 and C57BL/10 strains which are commonly
abbreviated as B6 and B10 respectively. New inbred strains can be named freely by
their originators as long as certain rules are followed: the name should be brief, and
it should begin with a capital letter followed by other capital letters (preferably) or numbers.
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#18" TARGET="_top">18</a></sup>
Strains with a common origin that have been separated prior to the F<sub>20</sub> generation must
be given separate symbols, although these symbols can indicate their relationship to
each other. All names should be registered with the appropriate contact person who is
indicated prominently in the current issue of <i>Mouse Genome</i>.

<P>Substrains can arise whenever two or more colonies of an established inbred
strain are maintained in isolation from each other for a sufficient period of time to
allow detectable genetic differences to become fixed. There are three specific
instances where substrain formation can be considered to have occurred: (1) when
branches of an inbred strain are separated before the F<SUB>40</SUB> generation when residual
heterozygosity is still likely, (2) when a branch has been maintained separately from
other branches for 100 or more generations, and (3) when genetic differences from
other branches are uncovered. Such differences can be caused by any one or more of
three factors: residual heterozygosity at the time of branching, mutation, or
contamination.

<P>Substrains are indicated by appending a slash (/) to the strain symbol followed by
an appropriate substrain symbol, for example, DBA/1 and DBA/2. A laboratory
registration code is often included within the substrain designation, for example,
C57BL/6J and C57BL/10J are two substrains of C57BL that are both maintained at the
Jackson Laboratory (indicated with a J). On the other hand, a different nomenclature
has been formulated recently to distinguish the same strain maintained without any
apparent genetic differences by two or more laboratories. In this case, the "&#064;"
character is appended to the strain symbol followed by the laboratory registration
code. For example, the SJL strain maintained by the Jackson Laboratory would be
symbolized as SJL&#064;J.

<a name="3.4.3"></a><H3>3.4.3 Locus names and symbols</H3>

<P>In the first set of rules for distinguishing gene symbols laid down by the
Committee on Mouse Genetics Nomenclature in 1940, it was stated that &#034;the initial
letter of the mutant gene symbol shall be the same as the initial letter of the mutant
gene, e.g. <i>d</i> for dilution. Additional letters shall be added to the initial letter if
necessary to distinguish it from symbols already in use&#034;
(<a href="../references.shtml#Snell1" TARGET="_top">Snell, 1941</a> p.242).
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#19" TARGET="_top">19</a></sup>
With over three thousand independent loci identified as of 1993, the necessity of using
symbols that contain more than one letter is now obvious. In fact, the recent
explosion in gene and locus identifications in the mouse has brought about a re-evaluation
of the entire basis for the naming of chromosomal entities. At the time
of this writing, a final consensus has not yet been reached. Thus, investigators are
cautioned to contact members of the
<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_home.html'-->nomen/" TARGET="_top">International Committee on Standardized Nomenclature for Mice</A>
before settling on a name for a new genetic entity.

<P>Each mouse locus is given a unique name and a unique symbol. In devising
new names, investigators should consider their suitability for inclusion into
databases. Thus, names should be limited in length to fewer than 40 characters
(including spaces), and should not include Greek letters or Roman numerals. The
symbol is a highly abbreviated version of the name. In published articles, locus
symbols (but not names) are always set in <i>italic</i> font. Symbols always begin with a
letter followed by any combination of letters or Arabic numbers without internal
white space. In the past, symbols were typically three to eight characters in length.
Today, database considerations set a preferred maximum number of characters at 10,
although this rule is frequently broken.

<P>Loci that are members of a related series of some kind are given the same
primary stem and symbol followed by a distinguishing number or letter. Thus, the
third esterase gene to be defined is named
"<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95442" TARGET="_top">Esterase 3</A>", with the symbol
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95442" TARGET="_top">Es3</A></i>, and the
second homeo box gene cluster to be identified is named
"<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96181" TARGET="_top">homeo box B cluster</A>"
with the symbol
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96181" TARGET="_top">Hoxb</A></i>. In the past, a hyphen was often used to separate the numeral
designation from the body of the gene symbol, e.g.
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95442" TARGET="_top">Es-3</A></i>. This practice has now been
discontinued and hyphens have been deleted from all symbols except in the special
cases discussed just below.

<P>When one member of a series has been further duplicated into a closely linked
cluster of related genes, a number can be appended to the cluster name; individual
genes in the
<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96181" TARGET="_top">Hoxb cluster</A> will be named
<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96182" TARGET="_top">homeo box B1</A>,
<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96183" TARGET="_top">homeo box B2</A> etc. with
symbols
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96182" TARGET="_top">Hoxb1</A></i>,
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96183" TARGET="_top">Hoxb2</A></i> etc. For clusters that were initially named with an appended
number &#151; like
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96743" TARGET="_top">Lamb1</A></i> &#151;
the individual symbols can be named by appending the cluster name with a hyphen followed by a number to obtain the symbols
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96743" TARGET="_top">Lamb1-1</A></i>,
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96744" TARGET="_top">Lamb1-2</A></i>, etc.

<P>All loci can be broadly separated into two classes. The first class includes loci
known to be functional or homologous to functional loci. With few exceptions,
these loci are genes or pseudogenes. The second class includes sequences identified
solely on the basis of DNA variation. Members of this latter class are referred to as
<A HREF="../glossary.shtml#Anonymous_locus" TARGET="_top">anonymous loci</A> because their function or lack thereof is unknown. The rules for
naming each of these classes of loci follow below.

<P><i>Gene names</i> should convey in a concise form, and as accurately as possible, the
character by which the gene is recognized. Genes can be named according to an
expressed phenotype
(<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97525" TARGET="_top">retinal degeneration</A> or
<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96925" TARGET="_top">shiverer</A>),
an enzyme or protein name or function
(<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95742" TARGET="_top">glyoxalase-1</A>,
<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96014" TARGET="_top">hemoglobin alpha chain</A>, or
<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:101898" TARGET="_top">octamer binding transcription factor 1</A>),
a pattern of expression
(<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:98640" TARGET="_top">t-complex testes-expressed-1</A>),
a combination of these
(<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97269" TARGET="_top">myosin light chain alkali-fast skeletal muscle</A>), or by homology to genes
characterized in other organisms
(<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96169" TARGET="_top">homeo box A</A>,
<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96181" TARGET="_top">homeo box B</A>, etc.;
<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97874" TARGET="_top">retinoblastoma</A>). Except in
the case of genes that are first characterized through a recessive mutation, names
and symbols should begin with an upper case letter. With all symbols, all letters
that follow the initial character should be lower case.

<P>Whenever a mouse gene is characterized based on homology to a gene already
named in another species, the mouse homolog should be given essentially the same
name and symbol. Of course, one should always check the mouse gene databases (see
<a href="b.shtml">Appendix B</a>) to be certain that the symbol has not already been assigned. In the
translation from human to mouse symbols, characters beyond the first should be
converted from upper to lower case.

<P>All <i>pseudogenes</i> are defined by homology to known genes. Their symbol is a
combination of the known gene name (as a stem), and the pseudogene designation
(<i>ps</i>) followed by a serial number. Thus, the
<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96017" TARGET="_top">third alpha globin pseudogene</A>
has been given the name
"<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96017" TARGET="_top">hemoglobin alpha 3 pseudogene</A>", with the symbol
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96017" TARGET="_top">Hba-ps3</A></i>.

<P>When new loci are uncovered by hybridization with known genes, the
functionality of the new locus is usually unknown. In these cases, where the locus
could be either a functional gene or a pseudogene, it should be named with a
&#034;related sequence&#034; symbol (<i>rs</i>). Thus, if a new locus is uncovered by cross-
hybridization with a probe for the
<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97620" TARGET="_top">Plasminogen</A> gene (symbolized
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:97620" TARGET="_top">Plg</A></i>), it would be named
&#034;Plasminogen related sequence-1&#034; and would be symbolized as
<i>Plg-rs1</i>. If a
new locus is uncovered with a probe for one member of a series of loci, the <i>rs</i>
symbol is appended without the hyphen. Thus, a locus related to
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95314" TARGET="_top">Ela1</A></i> would be symbolized as
<i>Ela1rs1</i>.

<P><i>Anonymous DNA loci</i> are named in a straightforward manner. The symbol
should begin with the character &#034;<i>D</i>&#034; (for DNA), followed by an integer representing
the chromosomal assignment, followed by a two to three letter registration code
representing the laboratory or scientist that described the locus, followed by a unique
serial number given to the locus to distinguish it from others on the same
chromosome described by the same investigator. For example, the twenty-third
anonymous locus mapped to chromosome 14 by the Pasteur Institute would be
given the symbol
<i>D14Pas23</i>. The name for this locus would include all of this
information in longhand form &#151;
&#034;DNA segment chromosome 14 Pasteur 23&#034;. This
DNA locus nomenclature system should be used for all loci defined only as DNA
segments including, but limited to, microsatellites, minisatellites and RFLPs (see
<a href="8-2.shtml">Chapter 8</a>). To
obtain a unique laboratory or investigator registration code, please contact the
<A HREF="http://www4.nationalacademies.org/cls/ilarhome.nsf/web/ilar_contact_information?OpenDocument" TARGET="_top">Institute for Laboratory Animal Resources</A>,
USA National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C.

<P><i>Mouse homologs of anonymous DNA loci first mapped in humans</i> are named
in a somewhat different format in order to allow the connection between the two
species to be perfectly transparent.

<P>In these cases, the symbol should still begin with
the character &#034;<i>D</i>&#034; and the mouse chromosomal assignment, but this should now be
followed by the character &#034;<i>h</i>&#034;, the chromosomal assignment of the human homolog
and its identification number. For example, a probe to the human locus
<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/gdb_clone.html'-->GDB:170033" TARGET="_top">D17S111</A> &#151;
the 111th single copy (S) anonymous locus mapped to human chromosome 17 &#151; is
used to identify a mouse homolog on Chr 1. This corresponding mouse homolog
will now be named
<i>D1h17S111</i>.

<a name="3.4.4"></a><H3>3.4.4 Alleles</H3>

<P>In the case of a gene defined initially by a mutant phenotype, the symbol for the
first defined mutant allele becomes both the gene symbol and the symbol for that
allele. The corresponding wild-type allele is indicated by a &#043; sign. For example, an
animal heterozygous at the
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:98711" TARGET="_top">tf</A></i>
locus with a wild-type and the defining mutant allele would have a genotype symbolized as
&#043;/<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:98711" TARGET="_top">tf</A></i>.
In this case, the context is sufficient to indicate the association of the &#043; symbol with the
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:98711" TARGET="_top">tf</A></i>
locus. When the context is not sufficient to indicate association, the wild-type allele of a specific locus should have
the locus symbol appended to it as a superscript. Thus, the wild-type allele at the
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:98711" TARGET="_top">tf</A></i>
locus can also be designated as
<A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:98711" TARGET="_top">&#043;<SUP><i>tf</i></SUP></A>.

<P>In all other cases, alleles are designated by the locus symbol followed by an allele-defining symbol
that is usually one or a two characters in length and set in
superscript, with the entire expression set in italics. This rule also applies to mutant
alleles beyond the first one that are uncovered at a phenotypically defined locus.
For computer presentation with only ASCII (text format) code, the allele designation
can be set off from the locus symbol by prefixing it with a * or with angular brackets;
for example,
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96020" TARGET="_top">Hbb<SUP>d</SUP></A></i> becomes
<I>Hbb*d</I> or
<I>Hbb&#060;d&#062;</I>.

<P>The simplest means for assigning allele names is through a series of lower case
letters, beginning with <i>a</i>. Thus, the
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96018" TARGET="_top">Hba-ps4</A></i> gene has alleles
<i>Hba-ps4<SUP>a</SUP></i>,
<i>Hba-ps4<SUP>b</SUP></i>, etc.
In many cases, it can be useful to provide information within the allele symbol. For
example, a <i>M. spretus</i>-specific allele may be given the designation <I>s</I> as in
<i>DXPas4<SUP>s</SUP></i>.
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#20" TARGET="_top">20</a></sup>
This type of nomenclature can be extended to alleles associated with the common
inbred strains such as B6 (signified by the <i>b</i> allele) and DBA (signified by the <i>d</i> allele)
as well as the subspecies <i>musculus</i> (<i>m</i>), <i>castaneus</i> (<i>c</i>), and <i>domesticus</i> (<i>d</i>).

<P>New &#034;random&#034; mutations &#151; at previously characterized genes are denoted by a superscript <i>m</i> followed by a serial number and the
1-3 letter code representing the laboratory or scientist that described the
new allele. When specific mutations are generated by the gene targeting technologies (see
<a href="6-4.shtml#6.4">Section 6.4</a>),
the same nomenclature applies except that the superscript <i>m</i> is proceeded by a superscript <i>t</i>.
Thus, the third knockout allele created at Princeton University by gene
targeting at the
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:88388" TARGET="_top">Cftr</A></i> locus would be designated as
<i>Cftr<SUP>tm3Pri</SUP></i>. To obtain a unique
laboratory or investigator registration code, please contact the
<A HREF="http://www4.nationalacademies.org/cls/ilarhome.nsf/web/ilar_contact_information?OpenDocument" TARGET="_top">Institute for Laboratory Animal Resources</A>,
USA National Academy of Sciences, Washington, D.C.

<a name="3.4.5"></a><H3>3.4.5 Transgene loci</H3>

<P>The experimental introduction of foreign DNA into the germ line of a mouse
results in the creation of a new <i>transgene</i> locus at the site of integration. The official
symbol for a transgene locus has five parts. First is the designation <i>Tg</i> for transgene.
Second is a letter indicating the mode by which the transgene was inserted; <i>N</i> is
used for nonhomologous insertion, <i>R</i> for insertion with a retroviral vector, and <i>H</i>
for homologous recombination. With the standard production of transgenic mice
by embryo injection, <i>N</i> would be used; with homologous recombination in
embryonal stem cells followed by
<A HREF="../glossary.shtml#Chimera" TARGET="_top">chimera</A> formation to rescue the transgene into
the germ line, <i>H</i> would be used; for transgenic animals produced by retroviral
infection of embryos, <i>R</i> would be used.

<P>The third part of the symbol contains a mnemonic, of six characters or fewer, that
describes the salient features of the transgene insert written within parentheses. If
the insert includes a defined gene, the gene symbol should be incorporated into the
mnemonic without hyphens. Other standard abbreviations for use within the
mnemonic include: <i>An</i> for anonymous sequence; <i>Nc</i> for noncoding sequence; <i>Rp</i>
for reporter sequence; <i>Et</i> for enhancer trap; <i>Pt</i> for promoter trap; and <i>Sn</i> for synthetic
sequence. The fourth part of the symbol is an investigator-assigned 1-5 digit
number. The fifth and last part is the laboratory code. An example of this
nomenclature is as follows. Castle has injected mouse embryos with a construct
containing the
<i>Pgk2</i> coding sequence as a reporter. He names the transgene locus
present in the fourth line that he recovers
<i>TgN(RpPgk2)4Cas</i>.

<P>When the insertion of a transgene at a particular site results in a new mutation
through the disruption of a gene present normally in the genome, this mutation
should be named independently of the transgene locus itself. The rationale for this
rule is that the contents of the transgene are independent of the locus uncovered
through insertional mutagenesis. However, the mutant allele associated with the
transgene should incorporate the transgene symbol as the superscripted allele
designation. For example, if Castle's construct became inserted into the
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96020" TARGET="_top">Hbb</A></i> locus in
the fifth line that he derived, the new
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='../include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:96020" TARGET="_top">Hbb</A></i> allele that was created would be called
<i>Hbb<SUP>TgNrpPgk25Cas</SUP></i>.
Notice that the parentheses have been removed from the allele
symbol. If a new mutation has been induced at a previously unidentified locus, the
mutant phenotype should be used to name the new locus.

<a name="3.4.6"></a><H3>3.4.6 Further details</H3>

<P>In this section, I have only touched upon those issues of nomenclature that will
be of most concern to the majority of molecular biologists involved in studies of the
mouse genome. In fact, the nomenclature rules developed for the mouse are rather
extensive and are discussed in much greater detail in the Lyon and Searle
compendium
(<a href="../references.shtml#Committee1" TARGET="_top">Committee on Standardized Genetic Nomenclature for Mice, 1989</a>),
with additions and changes published regularly in <i>Mouse Genome</i>. As a final note,
one must keep in mind that mouse genetic nomenclature will continue to evolve
with the field as a whole. As new types of genetic elements and inter-relationships
are uncovered, it will be the charge of the Nomenclature Committee to keep the
rules internally consistent and up to date.<BR>

<a name="5.4"></a><H2>5.4 REPETITIVE &#034;NON-FUNCTIONAL&#034; DNA FAMILIES</H2>

<P>In the 
<A HREF="5-3.shtml">preceding section</A>, we examined several different classes of DNA families 
with members that carry out a variety of tasks necessary for the survival of the 
organism. This section surveys a final major class of DNA families whose members 
in and of themselves do not function for the benefit of the animal in which they 
lie. This class can be subdivided further into individual families that are actively 
involved in their own dispersion &#151; the so-called <I>selfish genes</I> &#151; and those that 
consist of very simple sequences that appear to arise <I>de novo</I> at each genomic 
location. The selfish gene group can be further divided &#151; somewhat arbitrarily &#151; 
into subclasses based on copy number in the genome. Each of the resulting 
subclasses of repetitive DNA families will be discussed in the subsections that 
follow.

<a name="5.4.1"></a><H3>5.4.1 Endogenous retroviral elements</H3>

<P>Retroviruses are RNA-containing viruses that can convert their RNA genome 
into circular DNA molecules through a viral-associated reverse transcriptase which 
becomes activated upon cell infection. The resultant DNA &#034;provirus&#034; can integrate 
itself into a relatively-random site in the host genome. The genetic information 
present in the retroviral genome is retained within the integrated provirus, and 
under certain conditions, the provirus can be activated to produce new RNA 
genomes along with the associated proteins &#151; including reverse transcriptase &#151; that 
can come together to form new virus particles that are ultimately released from the 
cell surface by exocytosis. However, in many cases, stably integrated retroviral 
elements appear not be active.

<P>Once it has become integrated into a chromosome, the provirus will become 
replicated with every round of host replication irrespective of whether the provirus 
itself is active or silent. Furthermore, proviruses that integrate into the germ line &#151; 
through the sperm or egg genome &#151; will segregate along with their host 
chromosome into the progeny of the host animal and into subsequent generations 
of animals as well. In certain hybrid mouse strains, new proviral integrations into 
the germ line can be observed to occur at abnormally high frequencies 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Jenkins1" TARGET="_top">Jenkins and Copeland, 1985</a>).

<P>All strains of mice as well as all other mammals have endogenous proviral 
elements. These elements can be classified and subclassified according to the type of 
retrovirus from which they derived (ecotropic, MMTV, xenotropic, and others). 
Ecotropic elements are generally present at 0-10 copies 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Jenkins2" TARGET="_top">Jenkins et al., 1982</a>), 
MMTVs are present at 4-12 copies 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Kozak1" TARGET="_top">Kozak et al., 1987</a>), and non-ecotropic 
elements are present at 40-60 copies 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Frankel2" TARGET="_top">Frankel et al., 1990</a>). Loss and acquisition of 
new proviral sequences is an ongoing process and, as a consequence, the genomic 
distribution of these elements is highly polymorphic. Thus, these elements can be 
very useful as genetic markers as discussed in 
<a href="8-2.shtml#8.2.4">Section 8.2.4.</a>

<P>In addition to the DNA families clearly related to known retroviruses, there are a 
number of additional families that are retroviral-like in structure but are not clearly 
related to any known virus strain in existence today. The Intracisternal A Particle 
(IAP) DNA family is defined by homology to RNA sequences that are actually 
present within non-functional retroviral-like particles found in the cytoplasm of 
some types of mouse cells. The IAP family is present in &#126;1000 copies 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Lueders1" TARGET="_top">Lueders and Kuff, 1977</A>), 
but very few of these copies can actually produce transcripts. Another 
retroviral-like DNA family is called VL30, which stands for viral-like 30S particles 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Carter1" TARGET="_top">Carter et al., 1986</a>); 
there are approximately 200 copies of this element in the mouse genome 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Courtney1" TARGET="_top">Courtney et al., 1982</A>; 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Keshet1" TARGET="_top">Keshet and Itin, 1982</A>). 
There is no reason to expect 
that additional retroviral-like families will not be uncovered through further 
genomic studies.

<P>It is of evolutionary interest to ask the question: from where do retroviruses 
come? Retroviruses cannot propagate in the absence of cells, but cells can propagate 
in the absence of retroviruses. Thus, it seems extremely likely that retroviruses are 
derived from sequences that were originally present in the cell genome. The first 
retrovirus must have been able to free itself from the confines of the cell nucleus 
through an association with a small number of proteins that allowed it to coat, and 
thus protect, itself from the harsh extracellular environment. Of course, the protein 
most critical to the propagation of the retrovirus is the enzyme that allows it to 
reproduce &#151; RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, commonly referred to as reverse 
transcriptase. But where did this enzyme come from? Reverse transcriptase 
catalyzes the production of single stranded complementary DNA molecules from an 
RNA template. This enzymatic activity does not appear to be required for any 
normal cellular process known in mammals! How could such an activity &#151; without 
any apparent benefit to the host organism &#151; arise <I>de novo</I> in a normal cell? One 
possible answer is that reverse transcriptase did not evolve for the benefit of the 
organism itself but, rather, for the benefit of selfish DNA elements <I>within the 
genome</I> that utilize the enzyme to propagate themselves <I>within the confines of the 
genome</I> as described in the 
<A HREF="5-4.shtml#5.4.2">next section</A>.

<a name="5.4.2"></a><H3>5.4.2 The LINE-1 family</H3>

<P>The mouse genome contains three independent families of dispersed repetitive 
DNA elements &#151; called B1, B2, and LINE-1
<SUP><A HREF="notes.shtml#35" TARGET="_top">35</A></SUP>
(or L1) &#151; that are each present at more 
than 80,000 chromosomal sites 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Hasties1" TARGET="_top">Hasties, 1989</a>). The general name coined for 
genomic elements of this type that disperse themselves through the genome by 
means of an RNA intermediate is 
<I><A HREF="../glossary.shtml#Retroposon" TARGET="_top">retroposon</A></I>. Of the three major retroposon 
families, it is only L1 that appears to be derived from a full-fledged selfish DNA 
sequence with a self-encoded reverse transcriptase. The mouse L1 DNA family is 
very old and homologous repetitive families have been found in a wide variety of 
organisms including protists and plants 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Martin2" TARGET="_top">Martin, 1991</a>). Thus, LINE-related 
elements, or others of a similar nature, are likely to have been the source material 
that gave rise to retroviruses.

<P>Full-length L1 elements have a length of 7 kb; however, the vast majority (&#062;90%) 
of the &#126;100,000 L1 elements have truncated sequences which vary in length down to 
500 bp 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Martin2" TARGET="_top">Martin, 1991</a>). 
However, of the &#126;10,000 full-length L1 elements, only a few retain 
a completely functional reverse transcriptase gene which has not been inactivated by 
mutation. Thus, only a very small fraction of the L1 family members retain 
&#034;transposition competence,&#034; and it is these that are responsible for dispersing new 
elements into the genome. 

<P>Dispersion to new positions in the germ-line genome presumably begins with 
the transcription of competent L1 elements in spermatogenic or oogenic cells. The 
reverse transcriptase coding region on the L1 transcript is translated into enzyme 
that preferentially associates with and utilizes the transcript that it came from as a 
template to produce L1 cDNA sequences 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Martin2" TARGET="_top">Martin, 1991</a>). For reasons that are 
unclear, it seems that the reverse transcriptase usually stops before a full-length copy 
is finished. These incomplete cDNA molecules are, nevertheless, capable of 
forming a second strand and integrating into the genome as truncated L1 elements 
that are forever dormant.

<P>The L1 family appears to evolve by repeated episodic amplifications from one or 
a few progenitor elements, followed by the slow degradation of most new integrants 
&#151; by genetic drift &#151; into random sequence. Thus, at any point in time, a large 
fraction of the cross-hybridizing L1 elements in any one genome will be more 
similar to each other than to L1 elements in other species. In a sense, episodic 
amplification followed by general degradation is another mechanism of concerted 
evolution. 

<P>A large percentage of the mouse L1 elements share two <I>Eco</I>RI restriction sites 
located at a 1.3 kb distance from each other near the 3' end of the full-length 
sequence. With its very high copy number, this 1.3 kb fragment is readily observed 
in &#151; and, in fact, diagnostic of &#151; <I>Eco</I>RI digests of total mouse genomic DNA that has 
been separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and subjected to staining by ethidium 
bromide. This high copy number <I>Eco</I>RI fragment was originally given other 
names, including MIF-1 and 1.3RI, before it was realized to be simply a portion of L1.

<a name="5.4.3"></a><H3>5.4.3 The major SINE families: B1 and B2</H3>

<P>The two other major families of highly repetitive elements in the mouse &#151; B1 
and B2 &#151; are both of the SINE type with relatively short repeat units of &#126;140 bp and 
&#126;190 bp in length respectively. The significance of this short repeat length is that it 
does not provide sufficient capacity for these elements to actually encode their own 
reverse transcriptase. Nevertheless, SINE elements are able to disperse themselves 
through the genome, just like LINE elements, by means of an RNA intermediate 
that undergoes reverse transcription. Clearly, SINEs are dependent on the 
availability of reverse transcriptase produced elsewhere, perhaps from L1 transcripts 
or endogenous retroviruses.
 
<P>All SINE elements, in the mouse genome and elsewhere, appear to have 
evolved out of small cellular RNA species &#151; most often tRNAs but also 
(in the case of mice and humans) the 7SL cytoplasmic RNA which is one of the components of 
the signal recognition particle (SRP) essential for protein translocation across the 
endoplasmic reticulum 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Okada1" TARGET="_top">Okada, 1991</A>). Unlike the LINE families, however, SINE 
families present in the genomes of different organisms appear, for the most part, to 
have independent origins. The defining event in the evolution of a functional 
cellular RNA into an altered-function self-replicating SINE element is the 
accumulation of nucleotide changes in the 3' region that lead to self-complementarity 
with the propensity to form hairpin loops. The open end of the 
hairpin loop can be recognized by reverse transcriptase as a primer for strand 
elongation. Since hairpin loop formation of this type is likely to be very rare among 
normal cellular RNAs, the SINE transcripts in a cell will be utilized preferentially as 
templates for the production of cDNA molecules that are able (somehow) to 
integrate into the genome at random sites. Like the L1 family, the B1 and B2 
families appear to be evolving by episodic amplification followed by sequence 
degradation.

<P>The B1 element is repeated &#126;150,000 times, and the B2 element is repeated 
&#126;90,000 times 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Hasties1" TARGET="_top">Hasties, 1989</a>); 
together these elements alone account for &#126;1.3% of 
the material in the <I>Mus musculus</I> genome. The B1 element is derived from a 
portion of the 7SL RNA gene whereas the B2 element appears to be derived (in a 
complicated fashion) from a tRNA<SUP>lys</SUP> gene. Human beings have just one family of 
SINE elements, referred to as the &#034;Alu family,&#034; which is present in 500,000 copies 
and is also derived from 7SL RNA, although in an independent fashion from the 
mouse B1 element. Interestingly, the mouse genome does contain about 10,000 
copies of a retroposon family that is closely related to the human Alu family 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Hasties1" TARGET="_top">Hasties, 1989</a>). 

<a name="5.4.4"></a><H3>5.4.4 General comments on SINEs and LINEs</H3>

<P>A number of other independent SINE families have been identified in the 
mouse genome, but none are present in more than 10,000 copies. One such family 
of 80 bp tRNA-derived elements called ID was originally found in the rat genome at 
a copy number of 200,000; in the mouse genome, there are only 10,000 ID copies. In 
addition, there are probably other minor SINE families in the mouse genome that 
have yet to be well characterized.

<P>The total mass of SINE and LINE elements probably accounts for less than 15% of 
the mouse genome. With the efficient means of self-dispersion that these elements 
employ, one can ask why they haven't amplified themselves to even higher levels? 
The answer is almost certainly that if the amount of selfish DNA in a genome goes 
above a certain critical level, it will cause the host organism to be less fit and, thus, 
less likely to pass its selfish DNA load on to future generations. The existence of a 
critical ceiling means that the various SINE and LINE families are in direct 
competition for a limited amount of genomic real estate.

<P>If one assumes that each of the major highly repetitive families &#151; B1, B2 and L1 &#151; 
is dispersed at random, it is a simple matter to calculate that, on average, a member 
of each family will be present in every 20-30 kb of DNA. In fact, if one screens a 
complete genomic library with 15 kb inserts in bacteriophage lambda with a probe 
for each family, 80% of the clones are found to contain B1 elements, 50% are found 
to contain B2 elements, and 20% are found to contain the central portion of the full-length L1 element 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Hasties1" TARGET="_top">Hasties, 1989</a>). 
However, if one analyzes individual clones for 
the presence of both SINE and LINE elements, there is a significant negative 
correlation. In other words, SINE and LINE elements appear to prefer different 
genomic domains.

<P>To better understand the non-random distribution of the three major mouse 
repetitive families and to investigate possible correlations with chromosome 
structure, the karyotypic distribution of each family was investigated by fluorescence 
<I>in situ</I> hybridization or FISH 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Boyle1" TARGET="_top">Boyle et al., 1990</A> and 
<a href="10-2.shtml#10.2">Section 10.2</a>). Incredibly, the 
distribution of the LINE-1 elements corresponds almost precisely with the 
distribution of the Giemsa stained dark G bands. In contrast, both SINE element 
families co-localize to the lightly stained chromosomal regions located between G 
bands (R bands). When the same type of experiment was performed on human 
karyotypes, the same result was obtained &#151; the human SINE element Alu was found 
in R bands, whereas human LINE sequences co-localized with G bands 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Korenberg1" TARGET="_top">Korenberg and Rykowski, 1988</a>). 
Since, essentially all of the SINE and LINE elements 
integrated into the mouse and human genomes subsequent to their divergence 
from a common mammalian ancestor, the implication is that preferential 
integration into different chromosomal domains is a property of each element class. 

<P>The correlation between G and R bands and LINE and SINE distribution 
respectively is not perfect. Some chromosomal regions are observed to have an 
overabundance or underabundance of the associated sequences, and a small, but 
significant fraction, of elements are located outside the &#034;correct&#034; regions. One 
consistent exception to the general correlation is that centromeric heterochromatic 
regions, which normally stain brightly with Giemsa, do not have any detectable 
LINE elements in mice or humans. However, this exception can be easily 
understood in terms of the special structural role played by centromeric satellite 
DNA in chromosome segregation &#151; any integration of a LINE element would 
disrupt this special DNA and its function, and this would be selected against 
evolutionarily.

<P>As a final note, it should be mentioned that although the SINE and LINE 
elements have amplified themselves for selfish purposes, they have, in turn, had a 
profound impact on whole genome evolution. In particular, homologous elements 
located at nearby locations can, and will, act to catalyze unequal but &#034;homologous&#034; 
crossovers that result in the duplication of single copy genes located in between and 
the initiation of gene cluster formation as illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf55 = window.open('../figures/figure5-5.shtml', 'windowf55', 'width=700,height=430,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf55.focus()">Figure 5.5</A>.

<a name="5.4.5"></a><H3>5.4.5 Genomic stutters: microsatellites, minisatellites, and macrosatellites</H3>

<P>With large-scale sequencing and hybridization analyses of mammalian genomes 
came the frequent observation of tandem repeats of DNA sequences, without any 
apparent function, scattered throughout the genome. The repeating unit can be as 
short as two nucleotides (CACACACA etc.), or as long as 20 kb. The number of 
tandem repeats can also vary from as few as two to as many as several hundred. 
The mechanism by which tandem repeat loci <I>originate</I> may be different for loci 
having very short repeat units as compared to those with longer repeat units. 
Tandem repeats of short di- or trinucleotides can originate through random changes 
in non-functional sequences. In contrast, the initial duplication of larger repeat 
units is likely to be a consequence of unequal crossing over. Once two or more 
copies of a repeat unit (whether long or short) exist in tandem, unequal pairing 
followed by crossing over can lead to an increase in the number of repeat units in 
subsequent generations (see 
<a href="javascript:windowf84 = window.open('../figures/figure8-4.shtml', 'windowf84', 'width=700,height=370,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf84.focus()">Figure 8.4</A>). 
Whether stochastic mechanisms alone can 
account for the rich variety of tandem repeat loci that exist in the genome or 
whether other selective forces are at play is not clear at the present time. In any case, 
tandem repeat loci continue to be highly susceptible to unequal crossovers and, as a 
result, they tend to be highly polymorphic in terms of overall locus size.

<P>Tandem repeat loci are classified according to both the size of the individual 
repeat unit and the length of the whole repeat cluster. The smallest and simplest &#151; 
with repeat units of 1-4 bases and locus sizes of less than 100 bp &#151; are called 
microsatellites. The use of microsatellites as genetic markers has revolutionized the 
entire field of mammalian genetics (see 
<a href="8-3.shtml#8.3.6">Section 8.3.6</a>). Next come the minisatellites 
with repeat units of 10 to 40 bp and locus sizes that vary from several hundred base 
pairs to several kilobases (see 
<a href="8-2.shtml#8.2.3">Section 8.2.3</a>). Tandem repeat loci of other sizes do not 
appear to be as common, but a great variety are scattered throughout the genome. 
The term midisatellite has been proposed for loci containing 40 bp repeat units that 
extend over distances of 250 to 500 kb, and macrosatellites has been proposed as the 
term to described loci with large repeat units of 3 to 20 kb present in clusters that 
extend over 800 kb 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Giacalone1" TARGET="_top">Giacalone et al., 1992</a>). 
However, the use of arbitrary size 
boundaries to &#034;define&#034; these other types of loci is probably not meaningful since it 
appears that, in reality, no such boundaries exist in the potential for tandem repeat 
loci to form in the mouse and other mammalian genomes.

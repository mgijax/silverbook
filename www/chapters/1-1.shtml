<a name="1.1.1"></a><H3>1.1.1 The origin of the house mouse</H3>

<P>What is a mouse? Ask any small child and you will hear the answer &#151; a small 
furry creature with big ears and a big smile. Today, in Japan, Europe, America, and 
elsewhere, this question evokes images of that quintessential mouse icon &#151; Mickey; 
but even before the age of cinema, television, and theme parks, mice had entered 
the cultures of most people. In the English-speaking world, they have come down 
through the ages in the form of nursery rhymes sung to young children including 
&#034;Three blind mice&#034; and &#034;Hickory, dickory dock, the mouse ran up the clock....&#034; 
Artistic renditions of mice in the form of trinkets, such as those shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowf11 = window.open('../figures/figure1-1.shtml', 'windowf11', 'width=720,height=550,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf11.focus()">Figure 1.1</a> 
and on the cover of this book, are sold in shops throughout the world. Why has the 
mouse been in the minds of people for so long? The most obvious reason is that 
one particular type of mouse &#151; the so-called house mouse &#151; has lived in close 
association with most, if not all, human populations since the dawn of civilization.

<P>This dawn occurred at the end of the last ice age, some 10,000 years ago, across a 
region retrospectively called the Fertile Crescent that extends from modern-day 
Israel up through Lebanon and Syria and curves back down through Iraq toward the 
Persian Gulf 
(<a href="javascript:windowf12 = window.open('../figures/figure1-2.shtml', 'windowf12', 'width=680,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf12.focus()">Figure 1.2</a>). It was in this region at this time 
&#151; known as the neolithic transition &#151; 
that tribes of nomadic hunters and gatherers began to cultivate plants 
and domesticate animals as a means for sustenance 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Ammerman1" TARGET="_top">Ammerman and Cavalli-Sforza, 1984</a>). 
Farming eliminated the need for constant migration and brought 
about the formation of villages and the construction of permanent shelters for both 
people and their livestock. With the seasonal planting of crops, families needed to 
store dry food, in the form of grain, for both themselves and their animals. With 
food reserves in granaries and cupboards, the house mouse began its long 
interwoven history with humankind.

<P>The ancestors of the house mouse, who were concentrated in the steppes of 
present-day Pakistan at that time 
(<a href="javascript:windowf12 = window.open('../figures/figure1-2.shtml', 'windowf12', 'width=680,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf12.focus()">Figure 1.2</a>), had been living happily oblivious to 
people for eons, but suddenly (in terms of evolutionary time), migrants to the new 
Neolithic villages found mouse paradise in the form of a secure shelter with 
unlimited food 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Auffray1" TARGET="_top">Auffray et al., 1990</a>). With their ability to squeeze through the 
tiniest of holes 
&#151; adults can pass through apertures as small as a single centimeter in 
width 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Rowe1" TARGET="_top">Rowe, 1981</a>) 
&#151; our furry friends were clearly pre-adapted to take advantage 
of these Neolithic edifices, and with their agility and speed, they were able to stay 
one step ahead of the cleaver wielded by the farmer's wife. This pre-adaptation, and 
the opportunistic ability to eat almost anything, has allowed the house mouse to 
become the second most successful mammalian species living on earth today

<P>When people wandered out from the Middle East in search of new lands to 
cultivate, mice followed as stowaways within the vehicles used to carry household 
belongings. Later, they would travel with ship-borne merchants going to and from 
distant lands. In this millennium, it is not too farfetched to imagine mice traveling 
on the <i>Santa Maria</i> with Columbus to the new world, and on horse-drawn buggies 
with families emigrating from the original American colonies to the Western part 
of the continent. As people overcame harsh environments through the 
construction of artificial habitats, these became the natural environment for the 
house mouse. Freeloading on people has allowed the house mouse to enjoy a 
wider range than all species but one. Today, house mice can be found wherever 
there are permanent populations of people (as well as many places where there are 
none), in both urban and rural areas, on all of the continents, at altitudes as high as 
15,600 feet (4750 m), as far north as the Bering Sea and as far south as sub-Antarctic islands

<a name="1.1.2"></a><H3>1.1.2 Domestication and the Fancy Mouse</H3>

The fact that many &#034;grown-up&#034; humans and mice have had an adversarial 
relationship through most of history is evident in the derivation of the name that 
English speakers use to describe these creatures. <I>Mouse</I> can be traced back through 
the Latin <I>mus</I> and the Greek <I>mys</I> to the ancient Sanskrit mush, meaning "to steal". 
There was little that adults in the ancient world could do to prevent mice from 
overrunning granaries until the discovery of the natural predilection of cats for 
rooting-out and destroying small rodents. In fact, 
<a href="../references.shtml#Keeler1" TARGET="_top">Keeler (1931)</a> has suggested that 
the deification of the cat by the ancient Egyptians was due mostly to the role that it 
played in reducing house mouse populations. And an ancient Persian legend, from 
the millennium before Christ says that &#034;the moon chases the clouds as a cat chases 
mice&#034; 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Keeler1" TARGET="_top">Keeler, 1931</a>). In somewhat later times (900 AD), 
the Welsh fixed the price of cats based on their mouse-catching experience 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Sage1" TARGET="_top">Sage, 1981</a>). This image of the cat 
as a veritable biological-pesticide is prevalent in many early cultures, and could 
explain the original rationale for its domestication.

<P>Although mice and farmers may not have seen eye-to-eye, one can imagine the 
potential for a very different type of relationship between mice and people not 
directly affected by their dastardly deeds. This is because mice are often viewed in a 
very different light than other animals as best summed up in the words of a 
contemporary artist:

<blockquote>The mouse is a great friend to artists, then, because we like him. He doesn't 
seem to have any specially bad characteristics &#151; at worst, his life is a little drab, but 
we all suspect our lives of being just that... Not enough like us to unnerve us, he 
is a tiny creature (therefore clearly inferior) who looks up to us and fears us 
(therefore reassuring), who is not directly useful to us (therefore not a menial), and 
can be a pleasant furry companion without making extensive demands on us 
(therefore a true friend). No wonder artists appreciate the mouse; put him in a 
work and you win your human audience instantly... (
<a href="../references.shtml#Feingold1" TARGET="_top">Feingold, 1980)</a></blockquote>

<P>The house mouse was highly visible to children growing up on farms as well as 
in towns, and legend has it that the tame animals wandering in and out of Walt 
Disney's original cartoon studio in Kansas provided the inspiration for the creation 
of Mickey Mouse 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Updike1" TARGET="_top">Updike, 1991</a>). House mice can express a high level of 
interesting activity in a small amount of space when presented with various 
playthings. They can breed easily in captivity, their diets are simply satisfied, they 
can be housed in small spaces, and one can select artificially for increased docility in 
each generation. With continuous human contact from birth, mice acclimate to 
touch and can be handled quite readily.

<P>Early instances of mouse domestication, and even worship, by the ancient Greeks 
and Romans is described in detail by 
<a href="../references.shtml#Keeler1" TARGET="_top">Keeler (1931)</a>. From the classical period 
onward, the domesticated mouse has appeared in various Eurasian cultures. Of 
particular importance to the history of the laboratory mouse was the fondness held 
for unusual-looking mice by the Chinese and Japanese. This fondness led Asian 
breeders to select and develop a variety of mutant lines with strikingly different coat 
colors, some of which can be seen in detailed paintings from the eighteenth and 
nineteenth centuries. During the nineteenth century, the house mouse became &#034;an 
object of fancy&#034; in Europe as well 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Sage1" TARGET="_top">Sage, 1981</a>), and British, Chinese, and Japanese 
traders brought animals back and forth to develop new breeds. By the beginning of 
the twentieth century, European and American fanciers were familiar with lines of 
mice having fanciful names like white English sable, creamy buff, red cream, and 
ruby-eyed yellow 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Sage1" TARGET="_top">Sage, 1981</a>).

<P>A critical link between the mouse fanciers and early American mouse geneticists 
was Miss Abbie Lathrop, a retired school teacher who began, around 1900, to breed 
mice for sale as pets from her home in Granby, Massachusetts 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Morse1" TARGET="_top">Morse, 1978</a>)</a>. 
Conveniently, Lathrop's home and farm were located near to the Bussey Institute 
directed by William Castle of Harvard University (see 
<a href="1-2.shtml#1.2.2">Section 1.2.2</a>). Not only did 
Lathrop provide early mouse geneticists &#151; including Castle and his colleagues at 
Harvard and Leo Loeb at the University of Pennsylvania &#151; with a constant source of 
different fancy mice for their experiments, but she conducted her own experimental 
program as well with as many as 11,000 animals breeding on her farm at any one 
time between 1910 and her death in 1918 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Morse1" TARGET="_top">Morse, 1978</a>). Many of the common 
inbred lines so important to mouse geneticists today &#151; including C57BL/6 and 
C57BL/10 (commonly abbreviated as B6 and B10) &#151; are derived entirely from 
animals provided by Abbie Lathrop. A more detailed account of her contributions 
along with photographs of her breeding records and her farm can be found in a 
historical review by 
<a href="../references.shtml#Morse1" TARGET="_top">Morse (1978)</a>.

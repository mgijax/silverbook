<a name="3.3.1"></a><H3>3.3.1 The need to control genetic background</H3>

<P>With the many new tools of molecular genetics described throughout this book, 
it has become easier and easier to clone genes defined by mutant phenotypes. Often, 
mutant phenotypes involve alterations in the process of development or 
physiology. In these cases, simply having a cloned copy of a gene is often not enough 
to critically examine the full range of effects exerted by that gene on the 
developmental or physiological process. In particular, normal development and 
physiology can vary significantly from one strain of mice to the next, and in the 
analysis of mutants, it is often not possible to distinguish subtle effects due to the 
mutation itself from effects due to other genes within the background of the mutant 
strain. To make this distinction, it is essential to be able to compare animals in 
which differences in the genetic background have been eliminated as a variable in 
the experiment. This is accomplished through the placement of the mutation into a 
genome derived from one of the standard inbred strains. It is then possible to 
perform a direct comparison between mutant and wild-type strains that differ only 
at the mutant locus. Phenotypic differences that persist between these strains must 
be a consequence of the mutant allele.

<a name="3.3.2"></a><H3>3.3.2 Coisogenic strains</H3>

<P>In the best of all possible worlds, the mutation of interest will have occurred 
spontaneously within a strain of mice that is already inbred. In this case, one can be 
reasonably confident that the mutant animal differs at only a single locus from non-mutant 
animals of the same strain. If the mutation allows homozygous viability 
and fertility, it can be propagated as a strain unto itself by inbreeding offspring from 
the original mutant animal.
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#16" TARGET="_top">16</a></sup> 
If the mutation cannot be propagated in the 
homozygous state, it will be maintained by continuous backcrossing of heterozygous 
animals to the original inbred strain. In both cases, the new mutant strain is considered 
<i><A HREF="../glossary.shtml#Coisogenic" TARGET="_top">coisogenic</A></i> because its genome is identical (isogenic) to that of its sister 
strain except at the mutant locus. In the past, coisogenic strains could only be 
obtained by luck &#151; when a spontaneous mutation happened to occur within an 
inbred strain. Today, one can initiate the production of coisogenic strains at any 
cloned locus through the use of the gene targeting technology described in 
<a href="6-4.shtml">Section 6.4.</a>
 
<P>Coisogenic strains are named with a compound symbol consisting of two parts 
separated by a hyphen: the first part is the full or abbreviated symbol for the original 
inbred strain; the second part is the symbol for the mutation or variant allele. If the 
mutation is maintained in a homozygous state within the coisogenic strain, the 
mutant symbol is used alone; if the mutation is maintained in a heterozygous state, 
the &#043;/<i>m</i> genotype symbol is used (where <i>m</i> is the mutation). For example: if the 
mutation 
<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:102949" TARGET="_top"><I>nude</I></A> 
(<A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:102949" TARGET="_top"><i>nu</i></A>) 
appeared in the BALB/cJ strain, and the new coisogenic strain 
was homozygous for this mutation, its complete symbol would be [BALB/cJ-<i>nu</i>]; if 
the semidominant lethal mutation 
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:98472" TARGET="_top">T</A></i> 
appeared in the C57BL/6J strain, and the new 
coisogenic strain was maintained by backcrossing to the parental strain, its symbol 
would be [B6-<i>T</i>/&#043;].

<P>A large number of mouse mutations and variants with interesting phenotypic 
effects have been identified and characterized over the last 90 years. Most of these 
mutations were not found within strains that were already inbred and, to date, most 
of the genes that underlie these mutations remain uncloned. Thus, in all of these 
cases, coisogenicity is not a possibility. However, even when a gene has been cloned, and 
the generation of a coisogenic mutant through the gene targeting technology is a 
possibility, this approach is still extremely tedious and, at the time of this writing, 
there is no guarantee of a successful outcome. There are other reasons why 
spontaneous mouse mutations are often important even when the gene underlying 
the mutation has been cloned. The spontaneous mutation may not be a &#034;knockout&#034; 
but instead may exert a more subtle effect on gene function which could provide 
special insight into the action of the wild-type allele. Furthermore, the phenotypic 
effects of many older mutations have been studied in tedious detail by classical 
embryologists and other scientists, and it can be advantageous to a contemporary 
scientist to build upon these classical studies.

<P>The &#034;low-tech&#034; solution to the elimination of genetic background effects in the 
analysis of an established mutation, or any other genetic variant, is to use breeding 
protocols, rather than molecular biology, to generate strains of mice that 
approximate coisogenics to the greatest extent possible. Mice that have been bred to 
be essentially isogenic with an inbred strain except for a selected <i>differential 
chromosomal segment</i> are called <i>congenic</i> strains. The conceptual basis for the 
development of congenic mice was formulated by George Snell at the Jackson 
Laboratory during the 1940s and it led to the first and only Nobel Prize for work 
strictly in the field of mouse genetics.

<P>Snell was interested in the problem of tissue transplantation. Long before 1944, it 
was known that tissues could be readily transplanted between individuals of the 
same inbred strain without immunological rejection, but that mice of different 
strains would reject tissue transplants from each other. Although these 
observations were a clear indication of the fact that genetic differences were 
responsible for tissue rejection, the number and types of genes involved remained 
entirely unknown. In absentia, these genes were named

loci. The assumption was that the histocompatibility genes were responsible &#151; 
directly or indirectly &#151; for the production of tissue (or &#034;histological&#034;) markers that 
could be distinguished as &#034;self&#034; or &#034;non-self&#034; by an animal's immune system. If 
transplanted tissue and a host recipient carried identical genotypes at <i>all H</i> loci, there 
would be no immunological response and the transplant would &#034;take.&#034; However, if 
a single foreign allele at <i>any H</i> locus was present in the tissue, it would be 
recognized as foreign and attacked.

<P>Although the number of histocompatibility loci was unknown, it was assumed 
to be large because of the rarity with which unrelated individuals &#151; both mice and 
humans &#151; accept each other's tissues. The logic behind this assumption was the 
empirical finding that polymorphic loci are most often di-allelic and not usually 
associated with more than three common alleles. If

Surprisingly, 
22 of the 27 lines had trapped the same locus, which was given the name 
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" TARGET="_top">H-2</A></i> 
(by chance, it was the second one identified). Contrary to expectations, the

complex since it is known to be a tightly linked complex of 
genes) acts, for all effective purposes, as the only strong determinant of 
histocompatibility. Snell and his predecessors were misled by the false assumption 
that only a limited number of alleles are possible at any one locus. Instead, a subset 
of genes within the 
<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" TARGET="_top">H2</A></i> 
complex &#151; known as the class I genes &#151; are the most 
polymorphic in the genome with hundreds of alleles at each individual locus. The 
generic term &#034;major histocompatibility complex&#034; 
(<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:95894" TARGET="_top">MHC</A></i>) is now used to designate 
this complex locus in mice as well as its homolog in all other mammalian species 
including humans, where it was historically called <i>HLA</i> (for human leukocyte antigen).<a name="3.3.3.2"></a>

<a name="3.3.3.2"></a><H3><I>3.3.3.2 Creation of a congenic strain</I></H3>

<P>In the past, there were several different breeding schemes used to produce 
congenic mice depending on whether animals heterozygous for the donor allele at 
the differential locus were phenotypically distinguishable &#151; through a dominant 
form of expression &#151; from those not carrying the donor allele. It was often the case 
that the heterozygote could not be distinguished and, as a consequence, congenic 
strains had to be created through complex breeding schemes that allowed the 
generation of homozygotes for the variant allele in alternating generations. Today, 
identifying the heterozygote is almost never a problem since one will almost 
certainly map the locus of interest before undertaking the production of a congenic 
strain, and with a map position will come closely linked DNA markers. Therefore, 
the following discussion will be limited to the most direct, simple and efficient 
method of congenic construction known as the backcross or NX system, which is 
illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf34 = window.open('../figures/figure3-4.shtml', 'windowf34', 'width=300,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf34.focus()">Figure 3.4</a> 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Flaherty1" TARGET="_top">Flaherty, 1981</a>).
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#17" TARGET="_top">17</a></sup> 

<P>The backcross system of congenic strain creation is straightforward in both 
concept and calculation. The first cross is always an outcross between the <i>recipient 
inbred partner</i> and an animal that carries the <i>donor allele</i>. The donor animals need 
not be inbred or homozygous at the locus of interest, but the other partner must be 
both. The second generation cross and all those that follow to complete the protocol 
are backcrosses to the recipient inbred strain. At each generation, only those 
offspring who have received the donor allele at the <i>differential locus</i> are selected for 
the next round of backcrossing.

<P>The genetic consequences of this breeding protocol are easy to calculate. First, 
one can start with the conservative assumption that the donor (D) and recipient (R) 
strains are completely distinct with different alleles at every locus in the genome.
 
<P>Then, all F<sub>1</sub> animals will be 100% heterozygous <i>D/R</i> at every locus. According to 
Mendel's laws, equal segregation and independent assortment will act to produce 
gametes from these F<sub>1</sub> animals that carry <i>R</i> alleles at a random 50% of their loci and 
<i>D</i> alleles at the remaining 50%. When these gametes combine with gametes 
produced by the recipient inbred partner (which, by definition, will have only <i>R</i> 
alleles at all loci), they will produce N<sub>2</sub> progeny having genomes in which 
approximately 50% of all loci will be homozygous <i>R/R</i> and the remaining loci will 
be heterozygous <i>D/R</i> as illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf34 = window.open('../figures/figure3-4.shtml', 'windowf34', 'width=300,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf34.focus()">Figure 3.4</a>. 
Thus, in a single generation, the 
level of heterozygosity is reduced by about 50%. Furthermore, it is easy to see that at 
every subsequent generation, random segregation from the remaining heterozygous 
alleles will cause a further &#126;50% overall reduction in heterozygosity.

<P>In mathematical terms, the fraction of loci that are still heterozygous at the Nth 
generation can be calculated as [(1/2)<SUP>N-1</SUP>], with the remaining fraction 
[1 - (1/2)<SUP>N-1</SUP>] 
homozygous for the inbred strain allele. These functions are represented 
graphically in 
<a href="javascript:windowf35 = window.open('../figures/figure3-5.shtml', 'windowf35', 'width=580,height=350,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf35.focus()">Figure 3.5</a>. 
At the fifth generation, after only four backcrosses, the 
developing congenic line will be identical to the inbred partner across &#126;94% of the 
genome. By the tenth generation, identity will increase to &#126;99.8%. It is at this stage 
that the new strain is considered to be a certified congenic. As one can see by 
comparing Figures 
<a href="javascript:windowf32 = window.open('../figures/figure3-2.shtml', 'windowf32', 'width=550,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf32.focus()">3.2</a> and 
<a href="javascript:windowf35 = window.open('../figures/figure3-5.shtml', 'windowf35', 'width=580,height=350,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf35.focus()">3.5</a>, 
the development of a congenic line will take 
approximately half the time that it takes to develop a simple inbred line from 
scratch. The reason for this more rapid pace is the fact that one of the two mates 
involved at every generation of congenic development is already inbred. 
<P>Backcrossing can continue indefinitely after the tenth generation, but if the 
donor allele does not express a dominant effect that is visible in heterozygous 
animals, it will be easier to maintain it in a homozygous state. To achieve this state, 
two tenth generation or higher carriers of the selected donor allele are intercrossed 
and homozygous donor offspring are selected to continue the line through brother-sister 
matings in all following generations. The new congenic strain is now 
effectively inbred, and in conjunction with the original inbred partner, the two 
strains are considered a &#034;congenic pair&#034;.

<P>In some cases, it will be possible to distinguish animals heterozygous for the 
donor allele from siblings that do not carry it. In a subset of these cases, as well as 
others, a donor allele may have recessive deleterious effects on viability or fertility. 
In all such instances, it is advisable to maintain the congenic strain by a continuous 
process of backcrossing and selection for the donor allele at every generation. 
Congenic strains that are maintained in this manner are considered to be in a state 
of &#034;forced heterozygosity&#034;. There are two major advantages to pursuing this strategy 
whenever possible. First, the level of background heterozygosity will continue to be 
reduced by &#126;50% through each round of breeding. Second, the use of littermates 
with and without the donor allele as representatives of the two parts of the congenic 
pair will serve to reduce the effects of extraneous variables on the analysis of the 
specific phenotypic consequences of the donor allele.

<P>The rapid elimination of heterozygosity occurs only in regions of the genome 
that are <i>not</i> linked to the donor allele which, of course, is maintained by selection in 
a state of heterozygosity throughout the breeding protocol. Unfortunately, linkage 
will also cause the retention of a significant length of chromosome flanking the 
differential locus which is called the <i>differential chromosomal segment</i>. Even for 
congenic lines at the same backcross generation, the length of this segment can vary 
greatly because of the inherently random distribution of crossover sites. 
Nevertheless, the expected average length of the differential chromosomal segment in 
<A HREF="../glossary.shtml#centimorgan" TARGET="_top">centimorgans</A> can also be calculated as [200 (1 - 2<SUP>-N</SUP>)/N] where N is the 
generation number. For all values of N greater than 5, this equation can be 
simplified to [200/N]. This function is represented graphically in 
<a href="javascript:windowf36 = window.open('../figures/figure3-6.shtml', 'windowf36', 'width=580,height=380,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf36.focus()">Figure 3.6</a>. As one 
can see, the average size of the differential segment decreases very slowly. At the 
tenth generation, there will still be, on average, a 20 cM region of chromosome 
encompassing the differential locus derived from the donor strain.

<P>It is possible to reduce the length of the differential chromosomal segment more 
rapidly by screening backcross offspring for the occurrence of crossovers between the 
differential locus of interest and nearby DNA markers. As an example of this 
strategy, one could recover fifty congenic offspring from the tenth backcross 
generation and test each for the presence of donor alleles at DNA markers known to 
map at distances of one to five centimorgans on both sides of the locus of interest. It 
is very likely that at least one member of this backcross generation will show 
recombination between the differential locus and a nearby marker. The animal 
with the closest recombination event can be backcrossed again to the recipient strain 
to produce congenic mice of the eleventh backcross generation. By screening a 
sufficient number of these N<sub>11</sub> animals, it should be possible to identify one or more 
that show recombination on the opposite side of the differential locus. In this 
manner, an investigator should be able to obtain a founder for a congenic strain 
with a defined differential chromosomal segment of five centimorgans or less after 
just eleven generations of breeding.

<P>As the preceding discussion indicates, congenic strains differ from the previously 
described coisogenic strains in two important respects which must always be 
considered in the interpretation of unexpected data. First, congenic strains, 
especially those that have undergone only a minimum number of backcrosses, will 
have small random remnants of the donor strain &#151; so-called <i>passenger loci</i> &#151; 
scattered throughout the genome. In congenic strains maintained by inbreeding, the 
same passenger genes will be present in all members of the strain. In rare instances, 
traits attributed to the selected donor allele may actually result from one of these 
cryptic passenger genes. Such effects can be sorted out by breeding the congenic 
strain back to its original inbred partner. If a trait is due to a passenger gene, it will 
assort independently of the donor locus in subsequent backcrosses.

<P>The second difference between a congenic strain and a coisogenic strain is in the 
chromosomal vicinity of the differential locus. Congenic strains will always differ 
from their inbred partner along a significant length of chromosome flanking the 
differential locus; coisogenic strains will only differ at the differential locus itself and 
nowhere else. Thus, there is always the possibility that phenotypic differences 
between the two members of a congenic pair are actually caused by a closely linked 
gene rather than the selected differential locus. This potential problem is much 
more difficult to resolve by simple breeding protocols.

<a name="3.3.3.3"></a><H3>3.3.3.3 Nomenclature</H3>

<P>The nomenclature used for congenic strains is so similar to that used for 
coisogenic strains that it is sometimes not possible to distinguish between the two by 
name alone. In such cases, it is necessary to go back to the original source 
publication for clarification. There are, however, two nomenclature components 
which are unique to congenic strains. The first is used in those cases where a 
mutant or variant allele is transferred from one defined genetic background onto 
another. For example, one might wish to transfer the albino 
(<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:98880" TARGET="_top">c</A></i>) mutation from the 
BALB/<i>c</i> strain onto a B6 background. In cases of this type, the strain which 
"donates" the variant allele is symbolized after the recipient strain with the two 
strain symbols separated by a period. This is followed by a hyphen and the symbol 
for the variant allele. Thus, in the example just described, the congenic strain 
would be named 
B6.BALB-<i><A HREF="<!--#include file='include/mgi_acc.html'-->MGI:98880" TARGET="_top">c</A></i>.

<P>The final nomenclature component is an indication of the number and type of 
crosses that have occurred subsequent to the original mating between the recipient 
and donor animals. In the derivation of any new congenic strain, the first cross is 
always an outcross, and the offspring are considered members of the F<sub>1</sub> generation. 
The second cross is always a backcross, and the offspring are considered members of 
the N<sub>2</sub> generation. (Note that there is no such thing as an N<sub>1</sub> generation). The letter 
"N" is always used, followed by a subscripted number (N<sub><i>i</i></sub>), to describe a series of 
backcross events leading to a particular generation of animals. However, remember that 
N<sub>10</sub> generation offspring are the result of one outcross followed by an uninterrupted 
sequence of nine backcrosses to the same parental strain. Once a congenic strain is 
established, backcrossing to the parental strain is often stopped, and future 
generations are propagated by a simple inbreeding protocol. The number of 
generations of inbreeding is indicated, as always, with the filial generation symbol 
"F". For example, suppose that the albino mutation has been placed onto the B6 
background by an outcross followed by 14 generations of backcrosses, after which a 
brother-sister mating regime is begun and followed for eight more generations. The 
offspring produced at this stage would be considered to be members of the N<sub>15</sub>F<sub>8</sub> 
generation. When generational information is incorporated into the name of a 
congenic strain, the numbers are no longer subscripted. So, in this example, the 
complete name for the congenic animals at the stage indicated would be 
B6.BALB-<i>c</i> (N15F8).

<a name="3.3.3.4"></a><H3>3.3.3.4 Consomic strains</H3>

<P>Consomic strains are a variation on congenic strains in which a whole 
chromosome &#151; rather than one local chromosomal region &#151; is backcrossed from a 
donor strain onto a recipient background. In almost all cases, the donor 
chromosome is the Y. Like congenics, consomics are produced after a minimum of 
10 backcross generations. Backcrossing to obtain consomics for the Y chromosome 
must be carried out in a single direction &#151; males that contain the donor 
chromosome are always crossed to inbred females of the recipient strain. For 
example, to obtain a B6 strain consomic for the <i>M. m. castaneus</i> Y chromosome, one 
would start with an outcross between a B6 female and a <i>castaneus</i> male. F<sub>1</sub> males, 
and those from all subsequent generations, would also be mated with B6 females. 
After ten generations, the genetic background would be essentially B6, but the Y 
chromosome would be <i>castaneus</i>. This strain could be symbolized as B6-Y<SUP>CAS</SUP>. 
<a name="3.3.3.5"></a><H3>3.3.3.5 Conplastic strains</H3>

<P>Conplastic strains are another variation on the congenic theme, except that in 
this case, the donor genetic material is the whole mitochondrial genome which is 
placed into an alternative host. Since the mitochondrial genomes carried by all of 
the classical inbred strains are indistinguishable, conplasticity makes sense only in 
the context of interspecific or inter-subspecies crosses. Conplastic lines are generated 
by sequential backcrossing of females from the donor strain to recipient males; this 
protocol is reciprocal to the one used for the generation of Y chromosome-consomics. 
For example, to obtain a B6 strain conplastic for the <i>M. m. castaneus</i> 
mitochondrial genome, one would start with an outcross between a B6 male and a 
<i>castaneus female</i>. F<sub>1</sub> females, and those from all subsequent generations, would 
also be mated with B6 males. After ten generations, the nuclear genome would be 
essentially B6 with the same statistics that hold for congenic production 
(<a href="javascript:windowf35 = window.open('../figures/figure3-5.shtml', 'windowf35', 'width=580,height=350,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf35.focus()">Figure 3.5</a>), 
but all mitochondria would be derived from <I>castaneus</I>. This strain could be 
symbolized as B6-mt<SUP>CAS</SUP>.
 
<a name="3.3.4"></a><H3>3.3.4 Recombinant inbred and related strains</H3>

<a name="3.3.4.1"></a><H3>3.3.4.1 Recombinant inbred strains</H3>

<P>Recombinant inbred (RI) strains are formed from an initial cross between two 
different inbred strains followed by an F<sub>1</sub> intercross and 20 generations of strict 
brother-sister mating. This breeding protocol allows the production of a family of 
new inbred strains with special properties relative to each other that are discussed fully in 
<a href="9-2.shtml">Section 9.2.</a> Different RI strains derived from the same pair of original 
inbred parents are considered members of a set. Each RI set is named by joining an 
abbreviation of each parental strain together with an &#034;X&#034;. For example, RI strains 
derived from a C57BL/6J (B6) female and a DBA/2J male are members of the BXD 
set, and RI strains derived from AKR/J and C57L/J are members of the AKXL set. A 
complete listing of commonly used RI sets is given in 
<a href="javascript:windowt93 = window.open('../tables/table9-3.shtml', 'windowt93', 'width=600,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt93.focus()">Table 9.3</A>. 
Each RI strain in a 
particular set is distinguished by appending a hyphen to the series name followed by 
a letter or number. Thus, BXD-15 is a particular RI strain that has been formed from 
an initial cross between a B6 female and a DBA male. At any point in time, it is 
always possible to add a new strain to a particular set through an outcross between 
the same two progenitor strains followed by 20 generations of inbreeding. The RI 
strains represent an important tool in the arsenal available for linkage studies of 
newly defined DNA loci.
<a name="3.3.4.2"></a><H3>3.3.4.2 Recombinant congenic strains</H3>
<P>Recombinant congenic strains (abbreviated as RC strains) are a variation on the 
recombinant inbred concept 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Demant1" TARGET="_top">Demant and Hart, 1986</a>). As with RI strains, the 
initial cross is between two distinct inbred strains. However, the next two 
generations are generated by backcrossing, without selection, to one of the parental 
strains. This sequence is followed by brother-sister mating for at least 14 
generations. Whereas standard RI strains have genomes that are a mosaic of equal 
parts derived from both parents (as detailed in 
<a href="9-2.shtml#9.2.2">Section 9.2.2</a>), RC strains will have 
mosaic genomes that are skewed in the direction of the parent to which the 
backcrossing occurred such that a random 7/8 fraction of the genome will be derived 
from this parent, and a random 1/8 fraction will be derived from the other parent. 
Sets of RC strains have some interesting properties in terms of limiting the amount 
of the genome that has to be searched for multiple genes involved in quantitative 
traits. However, with the new PCR-based methods for genotyping highly 
polymorphic loci discussed in 
<a href="8-3.shtml#8.3">Section 8.3</a>, the advantages of the RC strains appear to 
have been superseded and they have not been used widely by the mouse genetics 
community.

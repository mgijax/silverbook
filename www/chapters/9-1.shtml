<a name="9.1.1"></a><H3>9.1.1 Mapping new DNA loci with established mapping panels</H3>

<P>When a new mouse locus has been defined at the DNA level, it can be mapped 
by three different approaches: somatic cell hybrid analysis, <i>in situ</I> hybridization, or 
formal linkage analysis. The first of these approaches is not applicable generally to 
the mouse because single chromosome hybrids have not been gathered together in a 
systematic way for the whole mouse genome. However, even in those cases where 
such hybrids exist, this type of analysis provides only a chromosomal assignment. 
The second approach &#151; <I>in situ</I> hybridization &#151; is more highly resolving than 
somatic cell hybrid analysis, but this protocol requires special expertise and the 
resolution is still less than that obtained routinely with linkage analysis. Both of 
these non-sexual mapping protocols have two advantages over all forms of linkage 
analysis. First, they do not require any prior knowledge of map positions for other 
loci. Second, they allow the mapping of non-polymorphic loci. Thus, in the early 
days of mouse molecular genetics, before many DNA markers had been placed onto 
the map, and before new methods for uncovering polymorphisms had been 
developed, both of these protocols served useful functions in the arsenal of general 
mapping tools.

<P>Today, the method of choice for mapping a new locus defined at the DNA level 
will always be formal linkage analysis. There are two interrelated reasons for this. 
First, a whole genome mouse linkage map of very high density has been developed 
with thousands of polymorphic DNA markers already in place and new ones being 
added each month 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Copeland2" TARGET="_top">Copeland et al., 1993</a>). The second reason lies within the 
existence of various mouse &#034;mapping panels&#034; that have been established by a 
number of investigators at different institutions around the world. 

<P>A mapping panel is a set of DNA samples obtained from animals that carry 
random recombinant chromosomes produced within the context of a specific 
breeding scheme. The most widely used mouse mapping panels are of two specific 
types. One consists of representative DNA samples derived from each strain of a 
recombinant inbred (RI) set or group of RI sets. The approach to mapping with RI 
strains will be detailed in 
<a href="9-2.shtml">Section 9.2.</a> The second type of widely used mapping panel 
contains samples derived from the offspring of an interspecific backcross between 
the two species, <I>M. musculus</I> and <I>M. spretus</I>. This approach will be discussed in 
<a href="9-3.shtml">Section 9.3.</a> It is also possible to design mapping panels that are based on an 
intercross between two F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid parents obtained in an interspecific or 
intersubspecific outcross between two different inbred strains 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Dietrich1" TARGET="_top">Dietrich et al., 1992</a>). 

<P>The power of mapping panels lies within the database of information that is 
already available for a large number of previously typed loci in members of the 
same defined cohort of animals. The most useful panels have been typed for at least 
200 independent DNA markers and, in fact, the most well-established 
panels have been typed for many more. In classical genetic terminology, this can be 
viewed as a multihundred point cross that provides linkage maps across the 
complete spans of all chromosomes in the genome. 

<P>Thus, the mapping of a new locus can be accomplished simply by genotyping 
each of the samples in the same cohort (or a subset thereof) for <I>just</I> the new locus of 
interest. It is never necessary to type more than one hundred animals in the initial 
analysis and, as discussed in 
Sections 
<A HREF="9-2.shtml">9.2</A> and 
<A HREF="9-4.shtml">9.4</A>, with a well-characterized panel, one 
can usually obtain a map position with the typing of 50 or fewer animals. A single 
investigator can easily carry out such an analysis in less than a week's time with the 
use of either a PCR analysis or Southern blotting. The results obtained are entered 
into the database containing all prior mapping information on the panel and a 
computational algorithm is used to determine the location of the new locus within 
the already-established linkage map. Essentially, this is accomplished by searching 
for concordant segregation between alleles at the new locus and those at one or 
more loci that have been previously typed on the same panel. With a well-established 
mapping panel, a first-order map position will always be obtained. 
A discussion of the two most important classes of mapping panels &#151; recombinant 
inbred strains and the interspecific backcross &#151; will be presented in Sections 
<a href="9-2.shtml">9.2</a> and 
<a href="9-3.shtml">9.3</a> of this Chapter. 

<a name="9.1.2"></a><H3>9.1.2 Anchoring centromeres and telomeres onto the map</H3>

<P>As discussed in 
<a href="5-2.shtml">Section 5.2</a>, all 21 chromosomes in the standard mouse 
karyotype (19 autosomes and the X and Y) are extremely acrocentric. Even with very 
high resolution light microscopy of extended prophase chromosomes, the 
centromere appears to lie at one end of each chromosome. Although there must be 
a segment of DNA containing at least a telomeric sequence that precedes the 
centromere, no unique sequence loci have ever been localized to this hypothetical 
segment. Thus, for all intends and purposes, one can view the genetic map of each 
chromosome as beginning with a centromere and ending with a telomere. 

<P>In the absence of centromere and telomere mapping information, a linkage map 
will be unanchored. As a result, the length of genetic material that lies beyond the 
furthermost marker at each end of the map will not be known. However, since both 
centromeres and telomeres are composed of repeated simple sequences that are 
shared among all chromosomes, their direct mapping requires special approaches.

<a name="9.1.2.1"></a><H3><I>9.1.2.1 Telomere mapping</I></H3>

<P>All mammalian telomeres are composed of thousands of tandem copies of the 
same basic repeat unit TTAGGG 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Moyzis1" TARGET="_top">Moyzis et al., 1988</A>; 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Elliott2" TARGET="_top">Elliott and Yen, 1991</A>). Early 
sequence comparisons indicated that while the basic repeat unit was highly 
conserved, occassional nucleotide changes could arise anywhere within the large 
telomeric sequence present at the end of any chromosome. 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Elliott2" TARGET="_top">Elliott and Yen (1991)</A> 
realized that one particular nucleotide change, from a G to a C in the sixth position 
of this repeat unit, would create a <I>Dde</I>I restriction site (CTNAG) that overlapped two 
adjacent repeats &#151; 
[TTAGG<U>C][TTAG</U>GG]. In the absence of such a change, the 
enzyme <I>Dde</I>I would not cut anywhere inside a particular telomeric region which 
would remain intact within a restriction fragment of 20 kb or more in size. In 
contrast, one or more substitutions of the type described would allow <I>Dde</I>I to reduce 
a telomeric region into smaller restriction fragments that could be detected by 
probing a Southern blot with a labeled oligonucleotide (called TELO) consisting of 
five tandem copies of the consensus telomere hexamer 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Elliott2" TARGET="_top">Elliott and Yen, 1991</a>). To 
date, strain-specific telomeric <I>Dde</I>I RFLPs have allowed the inclusion of telomeres 
from six mouse chromosomes as segregating markers in linkage studies 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Eicher3" TARGET="_top">Eicher and Shown, 1993</A>; 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Ceci1" TARGET="_top">Ceci et al., 1994</A>). More recently, another repeat sequence has been 
identified with a subtelomeric position in all mouse chromosomes 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Broccoli1" TARGET="_top">Broccoli et al., 1992</A>). In the future, it may be possible to develop 
analogous strategies for mapping telomeres with this subtelomeric repeat as well.

<a name="9.1.2.2"></a><H3><I>9.1.2.2 Centromere mapping with Robertsonian chromosomes</I></H3>

<P>Unfortunately, the satellite sequences present within all mouse centromeres are 
not amenable to the same type of mapping strategy just described. The problem is 
that each centromere contains about eight megabases of satellite sequences 
(<A HREF="5-3.shtml#5.3.4">Section 5.3.4</A>), which is about 400 times larger than a telomere.

<P>Consequently, base substitutions away from the consensus satellite sequence will be much more 
numerous; this will lead to whole genome Southern blot patterns, with any 
restriction enzyme, that are unresolvable smears.

<P>So, how does one go about placing centromeres onto a linkage map? One 
approach is to mark the centromeres of individual homologs with a Robertsonian 
fusion (see 
<a href="5-2.shtml">Section 5.2</a>). If a test animal is heterozygous for a particular 
Robertsonian chromosome, the segregation of the fused centromere can be followed 
in each offspring through karyotypic analysis. If the Robertsonian chromosome 
carries distinguishable alleles at linked loci, the recombination distance between the 
centromere and these linked loci can be determined by DNA marker typing. 

<P>Unfortunately, this approach is complicated by the finding that local recombination 
is suppressed in animals heterozygous for many Robertsonian chromosomes due to 
minor structural differences that interfere with meiotic pairing 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Davisson4" TARGET="_top">Davisson and Akeson, 1993</a>). Thus, the distance between 
the centromere and the nearest genetic locus is likely to be underestimated by this method.

<a name="9.1.2.3"></a><H3><I>9.1.2.3 Centromere mapping through secondary oocytes</I></H3>

<P>A second approach to determining distances between centromeres and linked 
markers is based on the genetic analysis of large numbers of individual &#034;secondary 
oocytes,&#034; which are the products of the first meiotic division. As shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowf91 = window.open('../figures/figure9-1.shtml', 'windowf91', 'width=700,height=400,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf91.focus()">Figure 9.1</A>, 
sister chromatids remain together in the same nucleus after the first meiotic 
division. Thus, in the absence of crossing over, the secondary oocyte will receive 
one complete parental homolog or the other, and would appear 034;homozygous&#034; for 
all markers upon genetic analysis. However, if crossing over does occur, the oocyte 
will receive both parental alleles at all loci on the telomeric side of the crossover 
event. Thus, all telomeric-side loci that were heterozygous in the parent will also 
appear heterozygous in the oocyte, but all centromeric-side loci will remain 
homozygous. The fraction of individual oocytes that are heterozygous for a 
particular genetic marker will be twice the linkage distance that separates that 
marker from the centromere since only half of the haploid gametes generated from 
a double allele oocyte will actually carry the recombinant chromatid.

<P>How does one go about determining the individual genotypes of large numbers 
of secondary oocytes? There are two basic protocols. The first to be developed was 
based on the clonal amplification of secondary oocytes within the form of ovarian 
teratomas 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Eicher2" TARGET="_top">Eicher, 1978</a>). Ovarian teratomas result from the parthenogenetic 
development of secondary oocytes into disorganized tumors that contain many 
different cell types. The inbred LT/Sv strain of mice undergoes spontaneous 
ovarian teratoma formation at a very high rate. This inbred strain in and of itself is 
not useful for oocyte-based linkage analysis since it is homozygous at all loci, but it is 
possible to construct congenic animals that are heterozygous for particular marker 
loci within an overall LT/Sv genetic background. In the cases reported, these 
congenic animals retain the high rate of teratoma formation associated with the 
parental LT/Sv strain 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Eppig1" TARGET="_top">Eppig and Eicher, 1983</A>; 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Artzt1" TARGET="_top">Artzt et al., 1987</A>; 
<A HREF="../references.shtml#Eppig2" TARGET="_top">Eppig and Eicher, 1988</A>). 
This approach is tedious in that a different congenic line has to be developed 
to map centromeres on each chromosome, but there is every reason to believe that 
the results obtained are an accurate measure of centromere-marker linkage distances 
in female mice.

<P>An alternative protocol for genotyping oocytes is based on DNA amplification 
(by PCR) rather than cellular amplification. The main advantage to this approach is 
that genotyping can be performed on oocytes derived from any heterozygous female 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Cui1" TARGET="_top">Cui et al., 1992</a>). Thus, in theory, this approach could be used to position the 
centromere relative to any marker on any chromosome. However, in practice, PCR 
amplification from single cells is difficult, and there is a high potential for artifactual 
results &#151; such as amplification from one DNA molecule but not its homolog.

<a name="9.1.2.4"></a><H3><I>9.1.2.4 Centromere mapping by </I>in situ<I> hybridization or Southern blots</I></H3>

<P>A third approach to positioning centromeres on linkage maps is based on direct 
cytological analysis. This approach is possible because of the divergence in 
centromeric satellite DNA sequences that has occurred since the separation of 
<I>M. musculus</I> and <I>M. spretus</I> from a common ancestor &#126;3 million years ago 
(see <a href="5-3.shtml">Section 5.3</a> and 
<a href="javascript:windowf22 = window.open('../figures/figure2-2.shtml', 'windowf22', 'width=720,height=580,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf22.focus()">Figure 2.2</a>). 
In particular, the major satellite sequence in M. musculus 
is composed of a 234 bp repeat unit that is present in 700,000 copies distributed 
among all the centromeres. This same 234 bp repeat unit is only present in 25,000 
copies spread among the centromeres in <I>M. spretus</I> 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Matsuda1" TARGET="_top">Matsuda and Chapman, 1991</a>). 
The 28-fold differential in copy number can be exploited with the technique of <I>in 
situ</I> hybridization to readily distinguish the segregation of <I>M. musculus</I> 
centromeres from <I>M. spretus</I> centromeres in the offspring of an interspecific 
backcross. This approach has now been used to anchor all of the mouse 
chromosomes at their centromeric ends 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Ceci1" TARGET="_top">Ceci et al., 1994</a>). The only caveat to 
mention is the possibility that interspecific hybrids have a distorted recombination 
frequency in the vicinity of their centromeres. 

<P>A final possibility, that has yet to be validated, is the mapping of centromeres as 
RFLPs observed on Southern blots in the same manner as described for telomeres in 
<a href="9-1.shtml#9.1.2.1">Section 9.1.2.1</a>. This approach may be possible with the use of a newly described 
repeat sequence that appears to be present in reasonable copy numbers adjacent to 
the centromeres of nearly every mouse chromosome 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Broccoli1" TARGET="_top">Broccoli et al., 1992</a>).

<a name="9.1.3"></a><H3>9.1.3 Statistical treatment of linkage data</H3>

<a name="9.1.3.1"></a><H3><I>9.1.3.1 Testing the null hypothesis</I></H3>

<P>Let us assume that two inbred strains of mice (B6 and C3H for example) carry 
distinguishable alleles (symbolized by <I>b</I> and <I>c</I> respectively) at each of two fictitious 
loci <I>Xy1</I> and <I>Gh3</I> as shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowf92 = window.open('../figures/figure9-2.shtml', 'windowf22', 'width=720,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf92.focus()">Figure 9.2</A>. 
An F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid between B6 and C3H will be 
heterozygous at each locus with a genotype of:<BR><BR>

<I>Xy1<SUP>c</SUP></I>/<I>Xy1<SUP>b</SUP></I>, 
<I>Gh3<SUP>c</SUP></I>/<I>Gh3<SUP>b</SUP></I><BR><BR>

If these two 
loci are linked on a single chromosome, the F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid will have one homolog with the 
<I>Xy1<SUP>c</SUP></I> and 
<I>Gh3<SUP>c</SUP></I> alleles, and the other homolog with the 
<I>Xy1<SUP>b</SUP></I> and 
<I>Gh3<SUP>b</SUP></I> alleles. By 
definition, linkage means that the F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid will produce a greater number of 
gametes carrying a parental set of alleles, either:<BR><BR>
 
<I>Xy1<SUP>b</SUP> Gh3<SUP>b</SUP></I> or 
<I>Xy1<SUP>c</SUP> Gh3<SUP>c</SUP></I><BR><BR>
 
than a recombinant set of alleles, either:<BR><BR>

<I>Xy1<SUP>b</SUP> Gh3<SUP>c</SUP></I> or 
<I>Xy1<SUP>c</SUP> Gh3<SUP>b</SUP></I>.<BR><BR>

As discussed at length in 
<a href="7-2.shtml">Section 7.2</a>, the actual distance that separates the two loci will determine the strength 
of their linkage in terms of the fraction of recombinant gametes. 

<P>If one could determine the haploid genotype (or 
<A HREF="../glossary.shtml#Haplotype" TARGET="_top">haplotype</A>) of each sperm 
produced by a C3H X B6 hybrid male, one would know for sure whether the two loci 
in question are linked. But with the typing of a finite number of progeny in an 
experimental cross, the answer is often not as clear. Let us say that 100 offspring 
from the F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid have been typed to test for linkage between <I>Xy1</I> and <I>Gh3</I> with the 
result that 62 carry parental allele combinations and 38 carry non-parental allele 
combinations. Do these data provide evidence in favor of the hypothesis: &#034;<I>Xy1</I> and 
<I>Gh3</I> are linked&#034;?

<P>Unfortunately, there is a problem with a general hypothesis that states &#034;genes A 
and B are linked&#034; in that there is no precise prediction of what to expect in terms of 
data from a breeding experiment. This is because linkage can be very tight so that 
recombination would be expected rarely, or linkage can be rather loose so that 
recombination would be expected frequently. Of course, the strength of linkage, if 
indeed the genes under analysis are linked, is unknown at the outset of the 
experiment. In contrast, there is a precise prediction of what to expect from the so-
called &#034;null hypothesis&#034; of <I>no</I> linkage between genes <I>A</I> and <I>B</I>. The prediction of 
this null hypothesis is that alleles at different genes will assort independently 
leading to a 50:50 ratio of gametes with parental or recombinant combinations of 
alleles.

<P>Thus, whenever geneticists wish to determine whether their data provide 
evidence for linkage (of any degree), what they actually do is ask the following 
question: are these data significantly different from what one would expect if the 
two loci were <I>not</I> linked? With this well-defined &#034;null hypothesis&#034;, it becomes 
possible to apply a statistical test to determine whether the data actually observed are 
significantly different from the expected outcome for no linkage. In the example 
above, with the analysis of 100 offspring, the null hypothesis would lead to a 
prediction of 50 animals with a parental allele combination and 50 animals with a 
recombinant allele combination in comparison with the observed results of 62 and 
38 respectively. Are these two sets of numbers significantly different from each 
other? If the answer is yes, this would suggest that the null hypothesis is false and 
that the two loci are indeed linked. On the other hand, if the observed data are not 
significantly different from those expected from the null hypothesis, the question of 
linkage will remain unresolved &#151; the two loci may be unlinked, but it may also be 
possible that the loci are linked and there are simply not enough data to detect it.

<a name="9.1.3.2"></a><H3><I>9.1.3.2 A comparison of mouse linkage data and human pedigree data</I></H3>

<P>Before launching into a discussion of the statistical treatment of linkage data, it is 
important to illuminate a critical difference between linkage analysis in the mouse 
and in humans. In nearly all cases of linkage analysis in the mouse, the parental 
combinations of alleles &#151; the so-called <I>phase of linkage</I> &#151; will be known with 
absolute certainty. In the example above, if we assume that the two loci in question 
are linked, we know that the 
<I>Xy1<SUP>c</SUP></I> and 
<I>Gh3<SUP>c</SUP></I> alleles will be present on one homolog and the 
<I>Xy1<SUP>b</SUP></I> and 
<I>Gh3<SUP>b</SUP></I> alleles will be present on the other homolog in the F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid, 
as illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf92 = window.open('../figures/figure9-2.shtml', 'windowf22', 'width=720,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf92.focus()">Figure 9.2</A>. 
With this information, we can tell immediately upon 
typing whether an offspring carries a parental or recombinant combination of 
alleles. 

<P>More often than not, the phase of linkage is not known with certainty in the 
analysis of human pedigrees. As a consequence, human geneticists are forced to 
employ more sophisticated statistical tools that evaluate results in light of the 
probabilities associated with each possible phase relationship for each parent in a 
pedigree 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Elston1" TARGET="_top">Elston and Stewart, 1971</a>). 
These <I>maximum likelihood estimation</I> (MLE) 
analyses are always performed by computer and they lead to the determination of 
<I>LOD</I> score graphs which show the likelihood of linkage between two loci over a 
range of map distances 
(<A HREF="../references.shtml#Morton1" TARGET="_top">Morton, 1955</a>). With most human pedigrees, it is 
impossible to count the actual number of recombination events that have occurred 
between two loci, and, as a consequence, it is impossible to determine even a <I>most 
likely</I> genetic distance separating two loci without the use of a computer. In 
contrast, all recombination events can be clearly detected in two of the three most 
common types of mouse breeding protocols &#151; the backcross and RI strains &#151; and 
with the intercross, all but a small percentage of recombination events can also be 
distinguished unambiguously (see 
<a href="javascript:windowf94 = window.open('../figures/figure9-4.shtml', 'windowf94', 'width=720,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf94.focus()">Figure 9.4</A>). 
With backcross and RI data in 
particular, linkage distance estimates can be easily determined by hand or with a 
simple calculator, and confidence limits around these estimates can be extrapolated 
from sets of tables (such as those in 
<A HREF="d.shtml">Appendix D</A>).

test for backcross data</I></H3>

<P>The standard method for evaluating whether non-Mendelian recombination 
results are statistically significant is the &#034;method of 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=450,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I>.&#034; 
Upon calculating a value for 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=450,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I>, 
one can use a look-up table to determine the likelihood that an observed set of 
data represents a chance deviation from the values predicted by a particular 
hypothesis. This determination can lead one to reject or accept the hypothesis that is 
being tested.

<P>In its most general form, the 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
statistic is defined as follows:<BR><BR>

<A NAME="equation9.1"></A>(Equation 9.1)<BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/9-1.jpg" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="76"><BR><BR>

where there are <I>n</I> potential outcome classes, each of which is associated with an 
observed number (<I>obs<SUB>i</SUB></I>) that is experimentally determined and an expected number 
(<I>exp<SUB>i</SUB></I>) that is calculated from the hypothesis being tested. It is obvious from a quick 
examination of 
<A HREF="#equation9.1">Equation 9.1</A> that as the differences between observed and expected

will also become larger. Thus the

grows larger and larger, the likelihood that the experimental data 
can be explained by the null hypothesis becomes smaller and smaller.

<P>Consider the case of a backcross with the (B6 X C3H) F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid described above to 
analyze the possibility of linkage between the fictitious loci <I>Xy1</I> and <I>Gh3</I>. In terms of 
these two loci, the F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid can produce four types of meiotic products which will 
engender four experimental outcome classes (

If one makes the a priori 
assumption that the two parental classes represent different manifestations of the 
same outcome of no recombination, and the two other classes represent, for all 
practical purposes, reciprocal products of the same recombination event, then the 
data can be reduced in complexity to a set of just two outcomes &#151; parental or 
recombinant.

test is used to analyze data obtained from a backcross and the 
null hypothesis is one of no linkage, a further simplification of 
<A HREF="#equation9.2">Equation 9.2</A> can be 
accomplished. In this case, the <I>expected</I> values for parental and recombinant classes 
will both be equivalent to half the total number (<I>N</I>) of offspring typed (which is the 
sum of the two observed values). Furthermore, the two observed values will both 
differ from the expected value by the same absolute number, and the square of each 
difference will yield the same positive value. Thus, the two terms in 
<A HREF="#equation9.2">Equation 9.2</A> 
can be combined to form: <BR><BR>

<IMG SRC="../images/9-3.jpg" WIDTH="236" HEIGHT="77"><BR><BR>

<A HREF="#equation9.3">Equation 9.3</A> can be simplified even further by substituting each appearance of <I>exp<SUB>r</SUB></I> 
with the equivalent expression (<I>obs<SUB>p</SUB> &#043; obs<SUB>r</SUB></I>)/2. The form of the equation that is so derived

<P>In plain English, 
<A HREF="#equation9.4">Equation 9.4</A> can be read as &#034;square the difference, divide by the 
sum&#034,; and this simple calculation can often be performed through mental 
calculations alone.
<SUP><A HREF="notes.shtml#70" TARGET="_top">70</A></SUP>

<P>Now we can return to our example from above with 62 parental and 38 
recombinant allele combinations and use 
<A HREF="#equation9.4">Equation 9.4</A> to determine the appropriate 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
value. The difference between the numbers in the two observation 
classes (62 - 38 &#061; 24) is squared to yield 576, and this value is divided by the total size of the sampled 
population (100) to yield 5.76.

<P>One more piece of information is required before it is possible to translate a 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I>
value into a measurement of significance &#151; the number of &#034;degrees of freedom&#034; (<I>df</I>) 
associated with the particular experimental design. The &#034;degrees of freedom&#034; is 
always one less than the total number of potential outcome classes (<I>df</I> &#061; <I>n</I> - 1). The 
rationale for this definition is that it is always possible to determine the number of 
events that have occurred in the any one class by subtracting the sum of the events 
in all other classes from the total size of the sample set. In the backcross example 
under discussion, we have defined two potential outcome classes: recombinant and 
parental. Knowing the number in either class, along with the total sample size, 
provides the number in the other class. Thus, the number of degrees of freedom in 
this case is one. 

<P>With a 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
value and the number of degrees of freedom in hand, one can proceed to a 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
probability look-up table such as the one presented in 
<a href="javascript:windowt91 = window.open('../tables/table9-1.shtml', 'windowt91', 'width=500,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt91.focus()">Table 9.1</A>. 
This table shows the 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
values that are associated with different &#034;<I>P</I> values.&#034; A <I>P</I> value is a 
measure of the probability with which a particular data set, or one even more 
extreme, would have occured just by chance if the null hypothesis were indeed true. 
To obtain a <I>P</I> value for the data set in the example under discussion, we would look 
across the row associated with one degree of freedom to find the largest 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
value that is still less than the one obtained experimentally. In this case, this procedure yields the 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
value of 3.8. Looking up the column from this 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
value, we obtain a <I>P</I> value of 0.05.
<SUP><A HREF="notes.shtml#71" TARGET="_top">71</A></SUP> 
We have now reached the final goal of our statistical test for significance.

<P>In this hypothetical example, our statistical analysis indicates that the data 
obtained would be expected to occur with a frequency of less than 5% if the two loci 
were not linked. However, is this result significant enough to prove linkage? To answer 
this question, it is very important to understand exactly what it is that the 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
test and its associated P value do and what they do not do. The outcome of a 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
test cannot <I>prove</I> linkage or the absence thereof. It just provides one with a quantitative 
measure of significance. What is a significant result? Traditionally, scientists have 
chosen a <I>P</I> value of 0.05 as an arbitrary cutoff. But with this choice, one will 
conclude <I>falsely</I> that linkage exists in one of every twenty experiments conducted on 
loci that are, in fact, not linked! As discussed below in 
<a href="9-1.shtml#9.1.3.6">Section 9.1.3.6</a>, the interpretation of a 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
value in modern genetic experiments that look 
simultaneously for linkage between a test locus and large numbers of genetic 
markers is subject to further restrictions that result from the application of Bayes' 
theorem.

<a name="9.1.3.4"></a><H3><I>9.1.3.4 The 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
test for intercross data</I></H3>

<P>It is instructive to consider the application of the 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
test to a breeding protocol with more than two potential outcome classes. The most relevant example of this 
type is the intercross between two F<SUB>1</SUB> hybrid animals that are identically 
heterozygous at two loci with a genotype of <I>A/a</I>, <I>B/b</I>. 
<a href="javascript:windowf93 = window.open('../figures/figure9-3.shtml', 'windowf93', 'width=720,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf93.focus()">Figure 9.3</A> 
illustrates the 
different types of F<SUB>2</SUB> offspring genotypes that are possible in the form of a Punnett 
square. In the absence of linkage between <I>A</I> and <I>B</I> one would expect each of the 
sixteen squares shown to be represented in equal proportions among the F<SUB>2</SUB> progeny. 
If one compares the actual genotypes present in each square, one finds that there is 
some redundancy with only nine different genotypes in total. These are as follows 
(with their relative occurrences in the Punnett Square shown in parenthesis):

<UL> 
<LI><I>A/A</I>, <I>B/B</I> (1) 
<LI><I>a/a</I>, <I>b/b</I> (1) 
<LI><I>A/a</I>, <I>B/b</I> (4) 
<LI><I>A/A</I>, <I>B/b</I> (2) 
<LI><I>A/a</I>, <I>B/B</I> (2) 
<LI><I>A/a</I>, <I>b/b</I> (2) 
<LI><I>a/a</I>, <I>B/b</I> (2) 
<LI><I>A/A</I>, <I>b/b</I> (1) 
<LI><I>a/a</I>, <I>B/B</I> (1) 
</UL>

However, as in the case of the backcross, these classes are 
not really independent of each other. In particular, two classes:

<UL>
<LI><I>A/A</I>, <I>B/B</I>
<LI><I>a/a</I>, <I>b/b</I>
</UL>

result from the transmission of parental allele combinations from both F<SUB>1</SUB> 
parents (zero recombinants in 
<a href="javascript:windowf94 = window.open('../figures/figure9-4.shtml', 'windowf94', 'width=720,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf94.focus()">Figure 9.4</A>), 
four classes: 

<UL>
<LI><I>A/A</I>, <I>B/b</I>
<LI><I>A/a</I>, <I>b/b</I>
<LI><I>a/a</I>, <I>B/b</I>
<LI><I>A/a</I>, <I>B/B</I>
</UL>

result from a single recombination event in one parent or the other, 
two classes result from two recombination events:

<UL>
<LI><I>A/A</I>, <I>b/b</I>
<LI><I>a/a</I>, <I>B/B</I>
</UL>

and the final class (<I>A/a</I>, <I>B/b</I>) is ambiguous and could result from either no recombination in 
either parent or recombination events in both parents. Thus, the the nine genotypic 
outcomes from the double heterozygous intercross can be combined into four truly 
independent genotypic classes. By adding up the number of squares included within 
any one class and dividing by the total (16), one obtains the fraction of offspring 
expected in each in the case of the null hypothesis:

<UL>
<LI>zero recombinants &#151; 1/8
<LI>single recombinants &#151; 1/2
<LI>double recombinants &#151; 1/8
<LI>ambiguous (zero or two recombinants) &#151; 1/4
</UL>

As discussed above, four outcome classes yield three degrees of 
freedom. 

<P>With this information, it becomes possible to set up a 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
test to evaluate the evidence for linkage between two segregating loci typed among the progeny of an 
(F<SUB>1</SUB> X F<SUB>1</SUB>) intercross. The special

recombination events (<I>obs<SUB>a</SUB></I> is the ambiguous class) and <I>N</I> is the total number of F<SUB>2</SUB> 
progeny typed. An comparison of the experimentally determined

<P>The 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
test does have some limitations in usage. First, it cannot be applied to 
very small data sets, which are defined as those in which 20% or more of the 
outcome classes have expected values that are less than five 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Cochran1" TARGET="_top">Cochran, 1954</a>). With 
this rule, it is possible to set minimum sample sizes required for the analysis of 
backcross data at 10, and F<SUB>1</SUB> X F<SUB>1</SUB> intercross data at 40. In actuality, a backcross or RI 
data set must include at least 13 samples to show significance in the case of no 
recombinants (based on the Bayesian correction described below). Furthermore, 
when the sample size is below 40 (in cases of one degree of freedom only), a more 
accurate <I>P</I> value is obtained if one includes the <I>Yates correction</I> for small numbers. 
This is accomplished by subtracting 0.5 from the absolute difference between 
observed and expected values in the numerator of 
<A HREF="#equation9.3">Equation 9.3</A>.

<P>A final point is that 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
analysis provides a general statistical test for significance 
that can be used with many different experimental designs and with null 
hypotheses other than the complete absence of linkage. As long as a null hypothesis 
can be proposed that leads to a predicted set of values for a defined set of data classes, 
then one can readily determine the goodness of fit between the null hypothesis and 
the data that are actually collected.

<a name="9.1.3.6"></a><H3><I>9.1.3.6 A Bayesian correction for whole genome linkage testing</I></H3>
 
<P>If one has reason to believe <I>from other results</I> that two loci are just as likely to 
be linked as not, then the <I>P</I> value obtained with the 
<I><a href="javascript:windowm6 = window.open('../figures/chisquared.shtml', 'windowm6', 'width=500,height=150,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowm6.focus()">Chi-squared</A></I> 
test can be used directly as an 
estimate of the probability with which the null hypothesis is likely to be true, and 
subtracting the <I>P</I> value from the integer one provides a direct estimate of the 
probability of linkage. However, when a previously unmapped locus is being tested 
for linkage to a large number of markers across the genome, there is usually no a 
priori reason to expect linkage between the new locus and any one particular marker 
locus. If we assume a particular experimental design such that linkage is detectable 
out to 25 cM on both sides of an unmapped locus
<SUP><A HREF="notes.shtml#72" TARGET="_top">72</A></SUP> 
and a total genome length of 
1,500 cM, then the fraction of the genome in linkage with the novel locus will be 
(25 &#043; 25)/1,500 &#126;&#061; 0.033. In other words, out of 100 markers distributed randomly 
across the genome, one would expect only 3.3 to actually be in linkage with any 
particular test locus. But, if one accepts a <I>P</I> value of 0.05 as providing evidence for 
linkage, then 5% of the unlinked 97 loci &#151; or an additional &#126;5 loci &#151; will be falsely 
considered linked according to this statistical test. As a consequence, the expected 
number of false positives &#151; five &#151; is larger than the expected number of truly linked 
loci &#151; 3.3. Thus, of the 8.3 positive markers expected, only 3.3 would be linked, and 
this means that a <I>P</I> value of 0.05 has only provided a probability of linkage of 40%. 
This situation is clearly unacceptable.

<P>The logical approach just discussed is referred to as Bayesian analysis after the 
statistician who first suggested that prior information on the likelihood of outcomes 
be included in calculations of probabilities. One can generalize from the example 
given to obtain a Bayesian equation for converting any <I>P</I> value obtained by

Of interest are the <I>P</I> values required to provide 
evidence for linkage with 95% probability. So long as the experimental design allows 
detection of linkage out to 15 cM, one can use a cutoff <I>P</I> value of 0.001 as evidence 
for linkage between any two loci. In accepting linkage at <I>P</I> &#060; 0.001, one is actually 
setting a limit for accepting less than one false positive result for every 20 true 
positive results. Later in this chapter, the Bayesian approach is used to calculate 
cutoff values for the demonstration of linkage with 95% probability in the case of RI 
strain data

<a name="5.2.1"></a><H3>5.2.1 The standard karyotype</H3>

<a name="5.2.1.1"></a><H3>5.2.1.1 Chromosome number and banding patterns</H3>

<P>All of the <i>Mus musculus</i> subspecies (<i>domesticus</i>, <i>musculus</i>, <i>castaneus</i>, and 
<i>bactrianus</i>) as well as the closely related species <i>M. spretus</i>, <i>M. spicilegus</i> and 
<i>M. macedonicus</i> have the same &#034;standard karyotype&#034; with 20 pairs of chromosomes, 
including 19 autosomal pairs and the X and Y sex chromosomes as shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowf51 = window.open('../figures/figure5-1.shtml', 'windowf51', 'width=450,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf51.focus()">Figure 5.1</A>. 
The correct chromosome number was first established by Painter in 1928 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Painter1" TARGET="_top">Painter, 1928</a>). 
Surprisingly, all of the 19 autosomes as well as the X chromosome appear to be 
telocentric, with a centromere at one end and a telomere at the other.
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#30" TARGET="_top">30</a></sup> 
The biological explanation for this uniformity in chromosome morphology is entirely 
unknown; however, it makes the task of individual chromosome identification 
much more difficult than it is with human karyotypes. Nevertheless, trained 
individuals can distinguish chromosomes on the basis of reproducible banding 
patterns that are accentuated with the use of various staining protocols. 
The most common of these includes a mild trypsin treatment followed by staining 
with the dye Giemsa to produce dark Giemsa-stained bands &#151; called G bands &#151; that 
alternate with Giemsa-negative bands &#151; called R bands for <i>reverse</i> G-bands. A variety 
of other staining protocols have been developed &#151; called R, Q, and T banding &#151; that 
are all based on the same principal of chromatin denaturation and/or mild enzymatic 
digestion followed by staining with a DNA-binding dye 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Craig1" TARGET="_top">Craig and Bickmore, 1993</a>). 
In general, all of these different protocols produce the same pattern of bands and 
interbands observed with Giemsa staining, although in some cases, the dark and light 
regions are reversed.

<P>The reproducibility of the alternative pattern of G and R bands 
observed with many different staining protocols implies an underlying difference in the 
structure of chromatin which, in turn, suggests an underlying heterogeneity in the long-range 
structure of the genome. In fact, numerous differences have been found in the DNA 
associated with the two types of bands. G band DNA condenses early, replicates late 
and is relatively A:T rich; in contrast, R band DNA condenses late, replicates early 
and is relatively G:C rich 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Bickmore1" TARGET="_top">Bickmore and Sumner, 1989</a>).
All housekeeping genes are located in R bands, while tissue-specific genes can be located 
in both G and R bands. Each band type is also associated with a different class of 
dispersed repetitive DNA elements: G bands contain LINE-1 elements whereas 
R-bands contain SINE elements (see 
<a href="5-4.shtml#5.4">Section 5.4</a> for a detailed discussion of these 
elements).

<P>With all of these contrasting properties, it becomes an interesting problem to 
distinguish between cause and effect in the generation of the two major types of 
chromosomal domains. In other words, is there a particular DNA element that 
defines the G or R bands and somehow contributes to the preferential association, 
or disassociation, of all other DNA elements that contribute to the characteristics of 
the band type? Further research will be necessary to unravel this problem.

<a name="5.2.1.2"></a><H3>5.2.1.2 Idiograms and band names</H3>

<P>As a mechanism for facilitating data presentation and for comparing results 
obtained by different investigators, the light and dark bands observed in a raw 
karyotype are usually converted into idiograms, which are black and white drawings 
of idealized chromosomes as shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowf52 = window.open('../figures/figure5-2.shtml', 'windowf52', 'width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf52.focus()">Figure 5.2</A>. 
Autosomes are numbered from 1 
to 19, in descending order of length. Major bands (alternating dark and light 
regions) within each autosome are designated with a capital letter starting from A at 
the centromere, and ascending in alphabetical order. With an increase in 
resolution, most major bands can be resolved into a series of smaller bands, which 
are numbered sequentially from 1 starting at the <i>proximal</i> &#151; or centromeric &#151; side of 
the major band and ending at the <i>distal</i> &#151; or telomeric &#151; side. Finally, when 
increased resolution allows the visualization of multiple minor bands within a 
single previously defined sub-band, these are designated with a number (in 
sequence from 1) demarcated with a decimal point. As an example of the use of this 
nomenclature, the designation 17E1.3 represents (in reverse order), the third minor 
band within the first sub-band within the fifth major band (all in order from the 
centromere) on the mouse chromosome ranked seventeenth in size (illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf71 = window.open('../figures/figure7-1.shtml', 'windowf71', 'width=700,height=450,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf71.focus()">Figure 7.1</A>).

<a name="5.2.1.3"></a><H3>5.2.1.3 Chromosome length and DNA content</H3>

<P>The amount of DNA present in each chromosome can be estimated by 
measuring its length &#151; cytologically &#151; relative to the sum of the lengths 
of all 20 chromosomes and multiplying this fraction by the total genome 
length of 3,000 mb 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Evans1" TARGET="_top">Evans, 1989</a>). 
From these measurements, one finds that the largest chromosome (1) has 
a DNA length of approximately 216 mb and the smallest chromosome (19) 
has a DNA length of 81 mb, with all others following in a near-continuum 
between these two values (see 
<a href="javascript:windowt94 = window.open('../tables/table9-4.shtml', 'windowt94', 'width=600,height=500,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowt94.focus()">Table 9.4</A> 
for estimates of the centimorgan lengths of individual chromosomes).

<a name="5.2.2"></a><H3>5.2.2 Robertsonian translocations</H3>

<a name="5.2.2.1"></a><H3>5.2.2.1 Presence in natural populations</H3>
<P>Since 1967, there have been numerous reports of wild-caught house mice with 
karyotypes containing fewer than 20 sets of chromosomes. The first report described 
a karyotype with 13 sets of chromosomes (seven metacentrics and 6 telocentrics) in 
mice captured from the &#034;Valle di Poschiavo&#034; in southeastern Switzerland 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Gropp1" TARGET="_top">Gropp et al., 1972</a>). 
The assumption was made that animals with such a grossly different 
karyotype could not possibly be members of the <i>M. musculus</i> species, and as a 
consequence, these Swiss mice were classified as belonging to a separate species 
named <i>Mus poschiavinus</i> and informally referred to as the &#034;tobacco mouse.&#034; In 
subsequent years, additional populations of animals from the alpine regions of both 
Switzerland and Italy were found with a variety of non-standard karyotypes having 
anywhere from one to nine metacentrics. Further studies of wild house mice by 
other investigators have led to the discovery of additional non-standard karyotypes 
in house mice from other regions of Europe as well as South America and Northern 
Africa 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Adolph1" TARGET="_top">Adolph and Klein, 1981</a>; 
<a href="../references.shtml#Wallace1" TARGET="_top">Wallace, 1981</a>; 
<a href="../references.shtml#Searle1" TARGET="_top">Searle, 1982</a>).

<P>When the &#034;<i>M. poschiavinus</i>&#034; animals and others with non-standard karyotypes 
were subjected to a variety of tests &#151; both morphological and genetic &#151; to determine 
their relatedness to <i>M. m. domesticus</i>, investigators were surprised to find that no 
characteristics, other than karyotype, distinguished these populations from each 
other. In particular, phylogenetic studies place the &#034;<i>M. poschiavinus</i>&#034; animals 
securely within the <i>M. m. domesticus</i> fold; thus the <i>M. poschiavinus</i> species name 
is inappropriate and should not be used.

<P>How can animals within the same species (and even sub-species) have 
karyotypes that have diverged apart so radically in what has to be a very short period 
of evolutionary time? The first point to consider is that the karyotypes are actually 
not as different from each other as they might appear to be at first glance. When 
subjected to staining and banding analysis, each arm of every metacentric 
chromosome uncovered to date has been found to be identical to one of the 
chromosomes present in the standard <i>M. musculus</i> karyotype. Thus, it would 
appear that all of the non-standard karyotypes have arisen by simple fusion events, 
each of which resulted in the attachment of two standard mouse chromosomes at 
their centromeres. These centromeric fusions, also referred to as whole arm 
translocations, have been given the formal name of Robertsonian translocations, 
because W. R. B. Robertson was the first to identify such chromosomes in the 
grasshopper.

<P>A three part nomenclature is used to describe each individually isolated 
Robertsonian chromosome. First, the &#034;Rb&#034; symbol indicates a Robertsonian; 
second, the two chromosomes that have fused together are separated by a dot and 
listed within parenthesis (with the lower numbered chromosome first); and third, 
the laboratory number and symbol are indicated. Thus, the twenty-third 
Robertsonian uncovered at the Institute for Pathology in Lubeck, Germany, that 
resulted from a fusion between chromosomes 10 and 15, would be designated 
Rb(10.15)23Lub.

<P>Why does the standard mouse karyotype contain no metacentric chromosomes, 
and at the same time, why do multiple metacentric chromosomes become fixed so 
rapidly in unrelated populations from isolated geographical regions? In the latter 
case, genetic drift alone does not appear to provide a satisfactory answer since 
metacentric fixation requires an intermediate stage during which animals must be 
karyotypically heterozygous; heterozygosity for one or more metacentric 
chromosomes will usually result in decreased fertility as a consequence of 
non-disjunction.
<sup><a href="notes.shtml#31" TARGET="_top">31</a></sup> 
Thus, spontaneously arising Robertsonians cannot be expected to 
survive in a population (let alone reach fixation) unless they engender a selective 
advantage to the animal within which they reside. Based on the limited, but 
scattered, occurrence of populations that contain Robertsonians, it would appear 
that they can only provide a selective advantage under certain environmental 
conditions, whereas under other conditions, mice are better served with only 
telocentric chromosomes. The mechanisms by which such selective pressures 
would operate on chromosome structure remain totally obscure at the present time.

<a name="5.2.2.2"></a><H3>5.2.2.2 Experimental applications</H3>

<P>Robertsonian translocations are useful as genetic tools in two types of 
experimental applications. Like other translocations, they can catalyze 
nondisjunction events in heterozygous meiotic cells which &#151; in this case &#151; can lead 
to the genetic transmission of both homologs of the affected chromosome through 
individual gametes. This phenomenon will be discussed in the 
<A HREF="5-2.shtml#5.2.3.1">following section</A>. 
In addition, Robertsonians are especially valuable as visible genetic markers in 
somatic cells. This usefulness is peculiar to the mouse where all chromosomes 
other than the Robertsonians will be telocentric. Under microscopic examination, 
Robertsonians can be easily distinguished as the only chromosomes with two arms.

<P>The advantages of using Robertsonians as genetic markers can be best exploited 
within animals that contain a single pair of such homologs on a standard karyotypic 
background. Numerous strains carrying single Robertsonian pairs have been 
generated through selective breeding between wild and laboratory animals. Each of 
the standard mouse autosomes is available within the context of a Robertsonian in 
one or more strains of this type, which can be purchased from the 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Jackson Laboratory</A>.

<P>The most useful Robertsonians are those with two chromosome arms that differ 
significantly in length. For example, if one is interested in the analysis of 
chromosome 2, it would make sense to work with a strain that carries the 
Rb(2.18)6Rma fusion in which the longer arm of the metacentric (Chr 2) will be 
easily distinguished under the microscope from the shorter arm (Chr 18).

<P>Robertsonians can be used as somatic markers for both analytical and preparative 
purposes. Analysis of a particular chromosome by <i>in situ</i> hybridization or other 
staining protocols is greatly aided by the ability to easily identify the relevant 
chromosome in all metaphase plates. Preparative microdissection for the purpose 
of generating subchromosome-specific DNA libraries 
(<a href="8-4.shtml#8.4">Section 8.4</a>) is less tedious and 
more rapidly accomplished by this easy identification 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Rohme1" TARGET="_top">R&#246;hme et al., 1984</a>). Finally, 
Robertsonians can be more easily distinguished from all other mouse chromosomes 
by fluorescence-activated flow sorting (FACS) methods for chromosome 
identification and purification 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Bahary1" TARGET="_top">Bahary et al., 1992</a>).

<a name="5.2.3"></a><H3>5.2.3 Reciprocal translocations</H3>

<a name="5.2.3.1"></a><H3>5.2.3.1 Derivation and genetics</H3>
<P>Although crossovers normally occur between homologous sequences present on 
sister chromatids, in rare instances, aberrant crossovers will occur between 
sequences that are non-allelic. When the two non-allelic sequences that partake in a 
crossover event of this type come from different chromatids in the same pair of 
homologs (as illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf55 = window.open('../figures/figure5-5.shtml', 'windowf55', 'width=700,height=430,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf55.focus()">Figure 5.5</A>), 
the result is a pair of reciprocal recombinant 
products that are &#034;unequal&#034; with one having a duplication and the other having a 
deletion of the material located between the two breakpoints. Intra-chromosomal 
unequal crossover events are discussed at length in 
<a href="5-3.shtml#5.3.2">Section 5.3.2.</a>

<P>When crossing over occurs between sequences located on entirely different 
chromosomes, the result is even more dramatic. As shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowf53 = window.open('../figures/figure5-3.shtml', 'windowf53', 'width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf53.focus()">Figure 5.3</A>, 
inter-chromosomal crossing over results in the production of two reciprocal 
translocation chromosomes. Although inter-chromosomal crossover events occur 
even less often than intrachromosomal events, the former are more much readily 
detected (in most cases) for two reasons. First, reciprocal translocations cause the 
swapping of entire distal portions of two different chromosomes. Since the portions 
being swapped are usually not equal in size and are always associated with different 
banding patterns, each resultant translocation chromosome will usually look quite 
different from any normal chromosome. So long as the breakpoints are not 
exceedingly close to the centromeres or telomeres, these aberrant chromosomes will 
be easily recognized through karyotypic analysis. Second, reciprocal translocations 
usually cause a significant reduction in fertility as a consequence of the unusual 
pairing that must occur during synapsis and the production of a high frequency of 
unbalanced gametes through adjacent-1 segregation discussed in more detail below 
and illustrated in 
<a href="javascript:windowf53 = window.open('../figures/figure5-3.shtml', 'windowf53', 'width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf53.focus()">Figure 5.3</A>. 
Unbalanced gametes derived from reciprocal 
translocation heterozygotes give rise to embryos that are partially trisomic or 
monosomic, and in some cases, these do not survive to birth.
<P>Unlike Robertsonian fusions, reciprocal translocations are not found in wild 
populations of mice. They can arise spontaneously in laboratory animals and they 
are recovered at a higher frequency in offspring of males that have been subjected to 
chemical mutagenesis or irradiation treatment (discussed in 
<a href="6-1.shtml#6.1.2">Section 6.1</a>). A large 
number of translocations have been recovered to date 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Searle2" TARGET="_top">Searle, 1989</a>) and strains 
homozygous for many can be purchased from the 
<A HREF="a.shtml">Jackson Laboratory</A>.

<P>As shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowf53 = window.open('../figures/figure5-3.shtml', 'windowf53', 'width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf53.focus()">Figure 5.3</A>, 
translocations will cause genetic linkage between 
chromosomal regions that assort independently in animals with normal karyotypes. 
<a href="../references.shtml#Eicher1" TARGET="_top">Eva Eicher (1971)</a> 
was the first to use this correlation between genetic linkage and 
karyotypic linkage to make a specific chromosomal assignment for a particular 
linkage group and by the end of the 1970s, all nineteen autosomal linkage groups 
and chromosomes had been paired together 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Miller1" TARGET="_top">Miller and Miller, 1975</a>). Higher 
resolution studies that compared genetic and cytological breakpoint positions 
provided a means for further mapping of genes to particular chromosome bands; 
these data also provided a means for determining the centromeric and telomeric 
ends of each linkage map 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Searle2" TARGET="_top">Searle, 1989</a>).

<a name="5.2.3.2"></a><H3>5.2.3.2 Chromosome segregation</H3>

<P>The main contemporary use of reciprocal translocations is as a tool to generate 
animals that receive both homologs of a chromosomal region from a single parent. 
To understand the genetic basis for this outcome, you can follow the process of 
chromosome segregation during meiosis for the fictitious reciprocal translocation 
heterozygote shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowf53 = window.open('../figures/figure5-3.shtml', 'windowf53', 'width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf53.focus()">Figure 5.3</a>. 
In this example, mouse chromosomes 2 and 8 have exchanged material.

<P>During the anaphase I stage of the first meiotic division, 
the two homologs of every chromosome &#034;disjoin&#034; from each other and are pulled 
to opposite poles by spindles that attach to the centromeric regions. This <i>disjunction</i> 
of chromosomes is the physical basis for the genetically observed segregation of 
alleles according to Mendel's first law. In mice with a normal karyotype, the 
segregation of any one pair of homologs will not affect the segregation of any other 
pair of homologs. Thus, individual homologs of different chromosomes that came 
into the animal together from one parent will go out into the offspring in an 
independent manner. This is the physical basis for Mendel's second law of 
independent assortment.

<P>In animals with a normal karyotype, chromosome disjunction will always lead 
to the production of gametes that are &#034;balanced&#034; with a complete haploid genome &#151; no more, no less. 
However, the same is not true with animals heterozygous for a 
reciprocal translocation. As shown in 
<a href="javascript:windowf53 = window.open('../figures/figure5-3.shtml', 'windowf53', 'width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf53.focus()">Figure 5.3</A>, 
there are two equally-likely 
outcomes called &#034;alternate segregation&#034; and &#034;adjacent-1 segregation.&#034; With the 
alternate segregation pathway, one gamete class will receive one chromosome (Chr 2) homolog and 
one Chr 8 homolog {2,8}, just like all gametes produced by mice with a normal 
karyotype. The other gamete class will receive both translocated chromosomes 
called 2' and 8' in this example {2',8'}; although the genetic material is rearranged, 
one complete haploid genome is present, and thus these gametes are considered to 
be "balanced". If a balanced {2', 8'} gamete joins together with a normal gamete during 
fertilization, the resulting animal will be a balanced, reciprocal translocation 
heterozygote just like the original parent.

<P>With the adjacent-1 segregation pathway, the two gamete classes are unbalanced 
in a reciprocal fashion. One will have a normal Chr 2 and a translocated Chr 8' 
{2, 8'}; this gamete is deleted for sequences at the distal end of the normal Chr 8 (8d) 
and duplicated with both homolog copies of sequences from the distal end of Chr 2 
(2d). The other {2',8} will be deleted for distal Chr 2 sequences (2d) and duplicated for 
distal Chr 8 sequences (8d).

<a name="5.2.3.3"></a><H3>5.2.3.3 Partial trisomies and uniparental disomies</H3>

<P>The special consequences of chromosome segregation from reciprocal 
translocation heterozygotes have been exploited with two types of breeding 
protocols. In the first, translocation heterozygotes are bred to animals with a normal 
karyotype. Adjacent-1 segregation will give rise to animals that are partially trisomic 
(for the distal end of one translocated chromosome) and partially monosomic (for 
the distal end of the other). Thus, by choosing appropriate translocations, it becomes 
possible to construct animals that are deleted or duplicated for particular genes of 
interest. By breeding in mutations at these loci, it becomes possible to construct 
genotypes of the {&#043;/&#043;/<i>m</i>} and {&#043;/<i>m</i>/<i>m</i>} variety 
(where &#043; and <i>m</i> are wild-type and 
mutant alleles respectively) as a means toward a better understanding of gene 
dosage effects and dominance and recessive relationships 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Agulnik1" TARGET="_top">Agulnik et al., 1991</a>; 
<a href="../references.shtml#Ruvinsky1" TARGET="_top">Ruvinsky et al., 1991</a>).

<P>In the second type of breeding protocol, animals heterozygous for the same pair 
of reciprocal translocations are mated to each other. The most interesting offspring 
to emerge from such unions are those formed through the fusion of 
complementary unbalanced gametes that represent the two different products of 
adjacent-1 segregation 
(<a href="javascript:windowf53 = window.open('../figures/figure5-3.shtml', 'windowf53', 'width=800,height=600,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes'); windowf53.focus()">Figure 5.3</a>). 
Although the resulting zygotes have fully 
balanced genomes &#151; they are not deleted nor duplicated for any sequences &#151; they 
carry two subchromosomal regions in which both homologs came from only one or 
the other parent respectively. In other words, for one chromosomal region, these 
animals are maternally disomic and paternally nullisomic; for the other 
chromosomal region, the opposite holds true.

<P>Uniparental disomy can also be obtained, albeit with lower frequency, in the 
offspring of matings between animals heterozygous for the same Robertsonian 
translocation. Pairing between the Robertsonian and the homologous acrocentric 
chromosomes can lead to <i>non-disjunction</i> with gametes that contain either two 
copies or no copies of one homolog represented within the Robertsonian. Once 
again, the fusion of two complementary nondisjunction gametes will lead to zygotes 
with fully balanced genomes but with whole chromosome uniparental disomy. 
Both whole and partial chromosome disomy provide powerful genetic tools for the 
analysis of genomic imprinting which is discussed later in this chapter 
(<a href="../references.shtml#Cattanach1" TARGET="_top">Cattanach and Kirk, 1985</a>).
